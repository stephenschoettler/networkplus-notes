## ðŸ’¡ Automating Network Inventories (OBJ 1.8)

Automating Network Inventories is crucial for tracking and maintaining an up-to-date inventory of all network assets (physical, virtual, cloud, software licenses). This represents a shift from manual, static lists to dynamic, real-time, automatically updating repositories.

âœ… **Benefits of Automation**
- **1. Real-time Updates:** Immediate awareness of connected devices and network risk.
- **2. Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) for automated device management.
- **3. Reduced Human Error:** Eliminates manual counting, improving accuracy.
- **4. Enhanced Security & Compliance:**
  - Identifies rogue devices.
  - Ensures compliance with regulations (e.g., PCI DSS).
  - Allows for immediate response to unauthorized connections.
  - Provides real-time network visibility (hardware, software, versions, ports, protocols) for better defense.

âœ… **Tools**
- **Nmap:** For IP and port scanning to discover devices and services.
- **Visualization Tools:** Zenmap, SolarWinds Network Topology Mapper, Intermapper for network mapping.
