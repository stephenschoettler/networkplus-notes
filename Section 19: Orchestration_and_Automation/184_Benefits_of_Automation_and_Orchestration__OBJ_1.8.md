## ðŸ’¡ Benefits of Automation and Orchestration (OBJ 1.8)

Automation and Orchestration are powerful tools revolutionizing efficiency, security, and effectiveness in network operations.

âœ… **Seven Main Benefits**
- **1. Increased Efficiency & Time Savings:** Automates repetitive tasks (patching, deployments, backups), freeing human resources and reducing errors.
- **2. Enforcing Baselines:** Consistently enforces security/compliance baselines, minimizing vulnerabilities.
- **3. Implementing Standard Configurations:** Facilitates and enforces standardized infrastructure configurations, with automated corrections for deviations.
- **4. Scaling Securely:** Dynamically scales resources (up/down) while maintaining security protocols (faster/more secure than manual).
- **5. Increased Employee Retention:** Automates mundane tasks, allowing employees to focus on strategic work, leading to higher job satisfaction.
- **6. Faster Reaction Times:** Enables rapid response to security incidents/anomalies (automated alerts, predefined actions). Crucial for threat mitigation.
- **7. Workforce Multiplier:** Augments staff capabilities, allowing smaller teams to manage larger, complex infrastructures, optimizing costs.
