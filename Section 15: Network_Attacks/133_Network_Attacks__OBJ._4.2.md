## ðŸ’¡ Network Attacks (OBJ 4.2)

This section aims to understand various types of attacks and their impact on the network. Network security is critical as networks are always on and connected to the internet, making them targets for malicious actors.

âœ… **CompTIA Objective 4.2**
- Summarize various types of attacks and their impact on the network.

âœ… **Key Concepts/Topics Covered in this Section**
- Denial of Service (DoS) & Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: Overloading/flooding networks and services.
- MAC Flooding: Overloading network switches to make them act like hubs, compromising data confidentiality.
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Attacks: ARP spoofing and ARP cache poisoning.
- VLAN Hopping: Moving from one secure subnet to another to breach confidentiality and integrity.
- Domain Name System (DNS) Attacks: DNS spoofing, DNS poisoning, DNS zone transfers.
- On-Path Attacks (Man-in-the-Middle): Attacker intercepts and proxies data between client and server.
- Rogue Devices & Attacks: Unauthorized devices (e.g., rogue APs, evil twins) connected to the network.
- Social Engineering Attacks: Manipulating users (e.g., phishing, spear-phishing, whaling).
- Malware Attacks: Malicious software (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojans).
