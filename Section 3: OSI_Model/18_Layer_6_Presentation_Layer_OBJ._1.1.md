## ðŸ’¡ Layer 6: Presentation Layer (OBJ 1.1)

The Presentation Layer (Layer 6) is responsible for **data formatting** and **encryption**. When you see "data formatting" or "encryption," think Layer 6.

âœ… **Data Formatting**
- Ensures compatibility between different devices and systems.
- Examples: ASCII (text), GIF, JPEG, PNG (images), MP4, MPEG, MOV (video).
- Scripting languages like HTML, XML, PHP, JavaScript also fall under data formatting as they dictate how text is displayed.

âœ… **Encryption**
- Scrambles data to keep it secure during transit and storage, providing confidentiality.
- Examples: TLS (Transport Layer Security), SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
- TLS/SSL create an encrypted tunnel to protect sensitive information (username, password, credit card).
