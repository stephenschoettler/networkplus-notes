## ðŸ’¡ Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) (OBJ 3.2)

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a security solution that provides real-time or near-real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications. Its purpose is to overcome the challenge of manually reviewing logs from numerous devices by aggregating logs and data from different systems into a single, combined data store.

âœ… **Benefits of SIEM**
- Allows cybersecurity analysts, system administrators, and network administrators to review logs and find abnormalities.
- Correlates events between different systems across the network, which is difficult to do manually.
- Speeds up threat detection and response time.
- Provides forensic tools and helps address compliance reporting requirements.

âœ… **Five Essential Functions of a SIEM**
- **1. Log Collection:** Gathers event records from various sources (e.g., using Syslog, typically UDP port 514 or TCP port 1468).
- **2. Normalization:** Maps log messages from different systems into a common data model, enabling analysis of related events despite varied source formats.
- **3. Correlation:** Links logs and events from different systems/applications into a single data feed to speed up threat detection.
- **4. Aggregation:** Reduces the volume of event data by consolidating duplicate events into single records.
- **5. Reportin**g: Presents correlated, aggregated event data in real-time dashboards for analysts and long-term summaries for management.

âœ… **Key Considerations for SIEM Deployment**
- **1. Log all relevant events:** Filter out irrelevant data.
- **2. Establish scope:** Define exactly what events will be logged.
- **3. Develop use cases:** Define what constitutes a threat and what actions to take.
- **4. Plan incident responses:** Have pre-planned responses for defined scenarios.
- **5. Establish ticketing process:** Track flagged events to completion.
- **6. Schedule regular threat hunting:** Proactively search for threats that automated alerts might miss.
- **7. Provide evidence trail:** Centralized logs serve as an evidence trail for auditors and analysts.

âœ… **Log Levels**
- Data brought into the SIEM is classified by log level (0-7), with 0 being most critical and 7 being most informational.

âœ… **Deployment Options**
- SIEMs can be deployed as software on a server, a hardware appliance, or an outsourced managed service.
