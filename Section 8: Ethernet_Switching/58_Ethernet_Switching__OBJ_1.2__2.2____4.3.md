## ðŸ’¡ Ethernet Switching (OBJ 1.2, 2.2, 4.3)

This section delves into Ethernet switching, which operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model. Its purpose is to understand how data is moved efficiently within a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet.

âœ… **CompTIA Network+ Objectives Covered**
- **OBJ 1.2:** Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
- **OBJ 2.2:** Configure switching technologies and features.
- **OBJ 4.3:** Apply network security features, defense techniques, and solutions.

âœ… **Key Topics Covered in this Section**
- **1. Ethernet Fundamentals:**
  - How Ethernet works and why it became the dominant LAN technology.
- **2. Network Devices:**
  - The evolution from Layer 1 devices (hubs) to Layer 2 devices (bridges) and modern Layer 2 switches.
- **3. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks):**
  - How to use VLANs to subdivide broadcast domains into smaller, more manageable, and secure segments.
- **4. VLAN Configuration:**
  - Practical aspects of setting up and managing VLANs.
- **5. STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):**
  - A crucial protocol used to prevent switching loops in redundant Ethernet networks.
- **6. NAC (Network Access Control):**
  - Security measures for controlling access to Layer 2 Ethernet networks.
- **7. MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):**
  - The default and maximum size of an Ethernet frame that can be transmitted over a network.
