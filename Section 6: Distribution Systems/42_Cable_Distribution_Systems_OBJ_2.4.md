## ðŸ’¡ Cable Distribution Systems (OBJ 2.4)

A **Cable Distribution System** is an organized system to connect the network's backbone (MDF) to intermediate distribution frames (IDFs) and then to end-user wall jacks. It is designed hierarchically for safe, secure, and functional placement. A best practice is to connect wall jacks to patch panels, then use patch cables from the patch panel to the switch. This protects expensive switch ports from wear and tear.

âœ… **Components of a Cable Distribution System**
- **1. Demarcation Point (Demarc):**
  - Location where the Internet Service Provider's (ISP) connection ends and your network infrastructure begins.
  - Signifies the entrance of the Wide Area Network (WAN) connection into your facility.
  - ISP is responsible up to this point; your organization is responsible beyond it.
  - Often located in the Main Distribution Frame (MDF).
- **2. Main Distribution Frame (MDF):**
  - Main starting point for all interior cabling distributed throughout the building.
  - All other telecommunications closets (IDFs) connect back to the MDF.
  - Contains the main point of presence router and the **backbone switch**.
- **3. Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF):**
  - Smaller distribution frames that connect back to the MDF.
  - Houses equipment to support offices and workstations closest to it (e.g., edge switches).
  - Cabling runs from IDFs to individual offices and wall jacks.
- **4. Cable Trays:**
  - Units or assemblies that form a rigid structural system to support cables and raceways.
  - Used for horizontal cable runs (e.g., in drop ceilings or under raised floors).
- **5. Vertical Cross-Connect:**
  - Used for vertical cable runs between floors.
  - Best practice is to minimize vertical runs, typically using trunk cables to connect MDF to IDFs.
- **6. Racks:**
  - House network equipment (switches, routers, patch panels, servers).
  - **Types:**
    - **2-post racks:** For lighter equipment, patch panels, cabling.
    - **4-post racks:** For heavier equipment (servers, UPS, large network hardware).
    - **Wall-mounted racks:** Space-saving for smaller equipment, ideal for limited floor space or edge switches.
    - **Rack enclosures (full cabinet racks):** Fully enclosed, secure, and protected environment for high-value equipment; often lockable.
- **7. Wall Jacks:**
  - Connect end-user devices to the network.
  - Normally configured for RJ-45 (copper) but can be fiber wall jacks.
- **8. Patch Panels:**
  - Device with multiple jacks for connecting and routing circuits.
  - **Purpose:** Keeps data centers/server rooms organized, makes it easier to move, add, or change cabling infrastructure.
  - **Copper Patch Panels:**
    - Front: RJ-45 network ports.
    - Back: 110 punchdown block (for CAT5/newer copper cables).
    - Uses a **punchdown tool** to terminate cables.
  - **Fiber Distribution Panels:**
    - Use fiber connectors (SC, LC, ST, MTRJ) on both front and back.
    - Act as couplers for fiber cables.
    - Can convert one type of fiber connection to another.

âœ… **Cable Distribution Flow (Example)**
- Computer connects to wall jack (RJ-45 or fiber patch cable).
- Wall jack's cable runs through walls/ceilings/trays to the IDF.
- Cable terminates into a punchdown block on the back of a patch panel in the IDF.
- Another patch cable connects the front of the patch panel to an open port on the edge switch in the IDF.

âœ… **Benefits of a well-designed cable distribution system**
- Hierarchical and organized structure.
- Easier support and maintenance.
- Increased flexibility for moves, adds, and changes.
- Protects expensive network equipment.
