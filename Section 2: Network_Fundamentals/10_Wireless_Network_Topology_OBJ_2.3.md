## ðŸ’¡ Wireless Network Topology (OBJ 2.3)

Wireless networks have two main physical modes and one combined topology.

âœ… **1. Infrastructure Mode**
- Most common type of wireless network (e.g., home Wi-Fi).
- Uses a centrally managed device (e.g., Wireless Access Point).
- Supports wireless security controls.
- Operates like a star topology wirelessly.

âœ… **2. Ad Hoc Mode**
- Decentralized, peer-to-peer network.
- No routers or access points; devices connect directly (e.g., laptop to laptop).
- Routing decisions are made dynamically.
- Allows devices to easily join and leave the network.

âœ… **3. Wireless Mesh**
- An interconnection of different nodes, devices, and radios to create a mesh topology.
- Combines various radio frequencies (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, microwave, cellular, satellite).
- Expands network access over large areas.
- Provides redundant and reliable connections, especially in harsh environments or disaster relief.
- Example: Combining Wi-Fi for local access, microwave for medium distances, and satellite for long distances to create a resilient network.
