## ðŸ’¡ IP Addressing (OBJ 1.5, 1.7, 1.8)

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It operates at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model and is used by routers to send data from one network to another, much like a postal address is used to send a letter to a specific house. It comes in two main formats: **IPv4** (older, 32-bit) and **IPv6** (newer, 128-bit).

âœ… **CompTIA Network+ Objectives Covered**
- **OBJ 1.5:** Explain common networking ports, protocols, services, and traffic types.
- **OBJ 1.7:** Use appropriate IPv4 network addressing.
- **OBJ 1.8:** Summarize evolving use cases for modern network environments.

âœ… **Key Topics Covered in this Section**
- **1. IPv4 Addressing:**
  - **Format:** Dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - **Address Types:** Public vs. Private IPs, Classful addressing (A, B, C, D, E), and special reserved ranges.
  - **Data Flows:** Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast.
  - **Assignment:** How clients receive their IP addresses.
- **2. Subnetting:**
  - **Purpose:** Dividing a large network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.
  - **Skills:** Will cover binary-to-decimal conversions, calculating network/broadcast addresses, and subnetting shortcuts.
- **3. IPv6 Addressing:**
  - **Format:** 128-bit hexadecimal addresses.
  - **Data Flows:** Unicast, Multicast, and Anycast.
- **4. IPv4 & IPv6 Compatibility:**
  - **Purpose:** To allow IPv4 and IPv6 networks to coexist and communicate.
  - **Methods:** Tunneling, Dual Stack, and NAT64.
