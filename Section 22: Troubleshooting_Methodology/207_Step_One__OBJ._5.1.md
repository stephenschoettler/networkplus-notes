## ðŸ’¡ Step One (OBJ. 5.1)
This section details the first step of the troubleshooting methodology: identifying the problem by gathering information from the user and understanding the symptoms, along with the critical importance of performing backups.

âœ… **Step 1: Identify the Problem**
- Purpose: Understand exactly what is wrong, symptoms, and potential causes.

âœ… **Gather Information from the User**
- Ask open-ended questions: "What happened?", "Status before/after?".
- Inquire about specific symptoms:
  - Error messages (exact wording/screenshots).
  - Noises (clicking, grinding).
  - Smells (burning).
- Determine scope: "Is anyone else affected?" (individual vs. network-wide).
- Ask about duration: "How long?" (tie to environmental changes).
- Inquire about recent changes: "Anything changed (hardware, software, security, environment)?" (most problems caused by changes).
- Ask about user's attempts: "What have you tried?" (avoid duplicating efforts).

âœ… **Perform Backups (if applicable)**
- **CRUCIAL before any changes** (Steps 2-6).
- Protects user data (documents, photos) from potential loss during troubleshooting/repair.
- Even minor changes can have unforeseen consequences.
