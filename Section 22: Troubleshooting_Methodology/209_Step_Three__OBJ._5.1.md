## ðŸ’¡ Step Three (OBJ. 5.1)
This section details the third step of the troubleshooting methodology: testing the theory of probable cause to determine the root of the problem and outlining the possible outcomes of this testing phase.

âœ… **Step 3: Test the theory to determine the cause**
- Purpose: Verify if the probable cause (from Step 2) is correct. This is where active testing begins.

âœ… **Process**
- Perform tests based on your theory.
- If theory is **confirmed**: Proceed to plan the solution.
- If theory is **not confirmed**: Return to Step 2 to establish a new theory.

âœ… **Four Possible Outcomes in Step 3**
- **1. Theory Confirmed:** Cause identified. Proceed to plan resolution.
- **2. Theory Not Confirmed:** Theory ruled out. Return to Step 2 for a new theory.
- **3. Problem Identified, but Lack of Skills/Authority:**
  - Cause found, but cannot fix (e.g., expensive part, out of scope for your team).
  - **Action:** Escalate to appropriate team/authority.
- **4. Stuck/Cannot Identify Cause:**
  - Multiple theories tested, still no confirmed cause.
  - **Action:** Escalate to the next higher tier of support (e.g., Tier 2, Tier 3).
