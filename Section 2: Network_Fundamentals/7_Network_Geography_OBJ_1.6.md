## ðŸ’¡ Network Geography (OBJ 1.6)

**Network Geography** categorizes networks by their size and geographical scope. Remember the order from smallest to largest (PAN, LAN, CAN, MAN, WAN) and their approximate distances/scope. Write down standards like "802.11 Wi-Fi" and "802.3 Ethernet" for quick reference.

âœ… **1. Personal Area Network (PAN)**
- Smallest network type (wired or wireless).
- Covers a very short distance, typically **10 feet (a couple of meters) or less**.
- Examples: Bluetooth connections (phone to car stereo), USB connections (USB hard drive to laptop), Firewire.

âœ… **2. Local Area Network (LAN)**
- Connects components within a limited distance.
- Generally up to **100 meters (300 feet)** for copper cabling (Cat 5). Fiber can go further.
- Examples: Small office network, one floor of an office building, home Wi-Fi network.
- Standards: IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi).

âœ… **3. Campus Area Network (CAN)**
- A building-centric LAN spread across numerous buildings in a specific area.
- Can cover **several miles** and multiple buildings.
- Examples: College campuses, business parks, military bases.
- Each building typically has its own LAN, which are then interconnected to form the CAN.

âœ… **4. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**
- Connects locations scattered across an entire city.
- Larger than a CAN, smaller than a WAN.
- Can cover an area up to about **25 miles** (or more depending on city size).
- Examples: Multiple campuses of a community college spread across a city, city department offices (e.g., DMV, police) linked across a city.

âœ… **5. Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- Connects geographically disparate internal networks.
- Covers large geographic areas: across a state, country, or even the world.
- Can consist of leased lines or VPNs tunneled over the internet.
- Example: The Internet itself is the largest WAN.
- WANs can be private (e.g., a company's internal network spanning multiple cities) or public (e.g., the Internet).
