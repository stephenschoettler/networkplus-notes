## ðŸ’¡ Network Components (OBJ 1.2)

Understanding these components is crucial for network design, management, troubleshooting, and security.

âœ… **Clients**
- Devices users access the network with (workstations, laptops, smartphones, smart TVs, Wi-Fi thermostats).

âœ… **Servers**
- Provide resources to the network (email, file, web servers; can be hardware or specialized software).

âœ… **Hubs**
- Older technology, connect network devices, broadcast all data, lead to increased network errors. (Evolved into switches).

âœ… **Switches**
- Smarter hubs, connect network devices, forward traffic only to intended recipients, provide more security and efficient bandwidth utilization.

âœ… **Wireless Access Points (WAPs/APs)**
- Allow wireless devices to connect to a wired network; broadcast data over radio frequency waves.

âœ… **Routers**
- Crucial for modern networks, connect different networks, make intelligent forwarding decisions based on IP addresses, use various routing protocols.

âœ… **Firewalls**
- Security barrier between internal network and external world (internet); monitor/control traffic based on security rules (ACLs); protect against unauthorized access and cyberattacks; can be hardware or software.

âœ… **Load Balancers**
- Distribute network/application traffic across multiple servers to increase efficiency, capacity, and reliability; prevent bottlenecks.

âœ… **Proxy Servers**
- Act as intermediaries between user devices and the internet; provide web filtering, shared connections, data caching, and enhance security/privacy by hiding user's IP.

âœ… **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
- Detect unauthorized access or anomalies and alert administrators.

âœ… **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**
- Detect threats and take action to prevent intrusion (e.g., blocking traffic, dropping harmful packets).

âœ… **Controllers (in SDN)**
- Central units in Software-Defined Networking that manage flow control to networking devices, enabling software-defined behavior for switches and routers.

âœ… **Network-Attached Storage (NAS)**
- Dedicated file storage system providing data access to clients over a network from a centralized location.

âœ… **Storage Area Networks (SAN)**
- High-speed networks providing access to consolidated block-level data storage; handle large data volumes and enhance storage devices.

âœ… **Media**
- Physical materials used to transmit the data (copper cable, fiber optic cable, wireless signals); each has unique properties and limitations.

âœ… **WAN Links (Wide Area Network Links)**
- Connect networks over large geographical areas (cities, countries) using technologies like leased lines, satellite, or cellular.
