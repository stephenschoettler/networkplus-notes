## ðŸ’¡ Network Services (OBJ 1.2 & 3.4)

- Network services are functions provided by the network infrastructure.
- They support various types of communications and processes.
- These services are crucial for the smooth operation of any network.

âœ… **CompTIA Network+ Objectives Covered**
- **OBJ 1.2:** Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
- **OBJ 3.4:** Implement IPv4 and IPv6 network services.

âœ… **Key Network Services Covered in this Section**
- **1. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
  - **Purpose:** Automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration information (e.g., subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server) to client devices.
  - Simplifies network administration by eliminating manual IP configuration.
- **2. SLAAC (Stateless Address Autoconfiguration)**
  - **Purpose:** Used in IPv6 to allow client devices to automatically configure their own IPv6 addresses without the need for a DHCP server.
  - Provides a method for self-configuration of IPv6 addresses.
- **3. DNS (Domain Name System)**
  - **Purpose:** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., 172.217.160.142).
  - Essential for web browsing and other internet services.
  - This section will cover how it works, different DNS record types, and security aspects.
- **4. NTP (Network Time Protocol)**
  - **Purpose:** Synchronizes the clocks of computer systems over a network.
  - Critically important for maintaining accurate time across all network-connected devices, which is vital for logging, security, and proper functioning of many applications.
- **5. QoS (Quality of Service)**
  - **Purpose:** Manages network resources to provide preferential treatment to certain types of traffic (e.g., voice, video) over others.
  - Ensures a higher level of service for critical applications by categorizing traffic and applying mechanisms to prioritize it.
