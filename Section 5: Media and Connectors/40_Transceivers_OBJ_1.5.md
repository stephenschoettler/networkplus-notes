## ðŸ’¡ Transceivers (OBJ 1.5)

A **transceiver** is a device that can both **transmit and receive data**. The name "transceiver" is a blend of "transmitter" and "receiver." QSFP modules are generally faster than SFP modules. You don't need to memorize specific speeds, but understand the relative performance.

âœ… **Protocols Transceivers Work With**
- **Ethernet:** Common networking technology for LANs, MANs, and WANs. Defines physical/electrical standards and data formats for wired networks (copper, fiber, wireless).
- **Fiber Channel (FC):** High-speed network technology primarily used to connect computer data storage to servers in Storage Area Networks (SANs). Known for high throughput, low latency, and data integrity.

âœ… **Functions of Transceivers**
- **Protocol Conversion:** Can convert data from one protocol to another (e.g., Ethernet to Fiber Channel and vice versa).
- **Media Conversion:** Convert network connections from one physical media type to another, even if the protocol remains the same (e.g., copper to fiber, fiber to copper, coaxial to fiber). They act as **media converters**.
- Transceivers are **Layer 1 devices**; they convert the signal format (e.g., electrical to light) and repeat it.

âœ… **Common Transceiver Form Factors (from slowest to fastest)**
- **SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable):** Compact, hot-pluggable optical module for fiber connections.
- **SFP+ (Small Form-Factor Pluggable Plus):** Faster version of SFP.
- **QSFP (Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable):** Supports four channels of data.
- **QSFP+ (Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable Plus):** Faster version of QSFP.
- **QSFP28 (Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable 28):** Even faster QSFP module.
- **QSFP56 (Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable 56):** Fastest QSFP module mentioned.

âœ… **Summary of Use Cases**
- Changing the physical format of network signals (e.g., electrical impulses from copper to light signals for fiber optic cables).
- Extending network distances (e.g., using fiber for long runs between buildings).
- Converting between different network protocols (e.g., Ethernet and Fiber Channel).
