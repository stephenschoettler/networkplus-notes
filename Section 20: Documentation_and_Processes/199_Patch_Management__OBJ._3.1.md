## ðŸ’¡ Patch Management (OBJ. 3.1)
This section defines patch management, outlining its importance for security, uptime, and compliance, and detailing the four critical steps involved in planning, testing, implementing, and auditing software patches.

âœ… **Patch Management**
- Definition: Planning, testing, implementing, and auditing of software patches.
- Importance: Increases security, uptime, compliance, and improves features.

âœ… **Benefits of Patch Management**
- **Security:** Fixes known vulnerabilities (CVEs).
- **Uptime:** Prevents crashes and resource exhaustion.
- **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements.
- **Features:** Provides software improvements and upgrades.

âœ… **Four Critical Steps**
- **1. Planning:** Policies, procedures, compatibility checks, deployment strategy.
- **2. Testing:** Crucial to test patches in a lab/small group (patch rings) before wide deployment to avoid new issues.
- **3. Implementation:** Deploy patches manually or automatically (SCCM, MDM). Centralized management recommended for large orgs.
- **4. Auditing:** Verify successful installation and functionality post-deployment.

âœ… **Firmware Management**
- Updating software (firmware) on network devices (routers, switches, firewalls).
- Essential for security and bug fixes, just like OS patching.
- Tools: Vendor-specific (Cisco IOS, UCS Manager), third-party.
