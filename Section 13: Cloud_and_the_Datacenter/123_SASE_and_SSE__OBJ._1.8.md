## ðŸ’¡ SASE and SSE (OBJ 1.8)

Traditional security models (strong perimeters) are inadequate for modern "deperimeterized" networks (cloud, remote work, mobile users). SASE and SSE blend network services with comprehensive security functions in a unified, cloud-centric approach. These frameworks enable organizations to enforce security policies consistently across all users, reduce latency, and improve user experience by not backhauling traffic to a central location. They are foundational components for security in distributed network architectures.

âœ… **SASE (Secure Access Service Edge)**
- **Definition:** Consolidates numerous Wide Area Networking (WAN) and security functions into a single, cloud-native service.
- **Purpose:** Provide secure and seamless access for end-users regardless of their physical location or device. Addresses challenges of securing distributed users/data.
- **Key Aspect:** Uses Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to deliver security and networking services from the cloud, offering flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency.
- **Included Services:** Firewalls, VPNs, Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB).
- **Cloud Provider Alignment:** Major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) offer services that align with SASE concepts.

âœ… **SSE (Security Service Edge)**
- **Definition:** A key subset of the SASE model that focuses exclusively on the security services necessary to protect access between users, devices, and the cloud.
- **Distinction from SASE:** SASE combines WAN and security; SSE focuses only on the security aspects.
- **Purpose:** Address the sophisticated threat landscape in a world without traditional security perimeters. Delivers security capabilities as a service.
- **Included Technologies:** Secure Web Gateways (SWG), Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).
