## ðŸ’¡ Physical Security (OBJ 4.1)

If an attacker can physically access networking equipment, they can bypass logical controls (change configurations, patch around devices). Physical security is a foundational layer.

âœ… **Detection Mechanisms (Detective Controls - identify after the fact)**
- **1. Cameras (CCTV):**
  - **Placement:** Entrances/exits of MDFS, IDFs, data centers, telecom closets, building entrances, parking lots.
  - **Types:** Wired/wireless, indoor/outdoor, fixed/PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom), infrared (thermal imaging - detects heat), ultrasonic (sound-based detection).
  - **Use:** Monitor access, record video for post-incident review, detect suspicious activity.
- **2. Motion Detectors:** Detect movement in secure areas.
- **3. Asset Tags & Tamper Detection:** Identify and track equipment, detect if devices have been tampered with.

âœ… **Prevention Mechanisms (Preventive Controls - stop before it happens)**
- **1. Access Control Hardware:**
  - **Badge Readers:** Magnetic strip, chip card, RFID. Often combined with a PIN for two-factor authentication.
  - **Biometric Readers:** Fingerprint, retina scan, voice print. Can be combined with a PIN for MFA.
- **2. Access Control Vestibules (Man Traps):**
  - **Definition:** An area between two doorways that holds people until they are identified and authenticated.
  - **Mechanism:** One door must close before the next opens. Can be automated or manned.
- **3. Personal Electronic Device Restrictions:**
  - **Policy:** Prohibiting personal devices (cell phones, smartphones, tablets) in secure areas.
  - **Purpose:** Data Loss Prevention (DLP).
  - **Implementation:** Smart lockers at entrances.
- **4. Locking Racks & Cabinets:**
  - Physical locks on server racks and network cabinets.
  - Key custodians maintain logs.
- **5. Employee Training:**
  - **Most Beneficial Prevention Mechanism:** Users are often the weakest link.
  - **Focus:** Proper policies and procedures for physical and technical security.
  - **High ROI:** Significant return on investment for cybersecurity awareness training.
