## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting Wireless Issues (OBJ. 5.4)
This section focuses on identifying and resolving common problems in wireless networks, specifically Wi-Fi (802.11 standards), aligning with Objective 5.4 of the Network+ exam.

âœ… **Troubleshooting Wireless Issues**
- This section focuses on identifying and resolving common problems in wireless networks (specifically Wi-Fi/802.11 standards).
- **Objective 5.4:** Given a scenario, troubleshoot common performance issues (wireless).

âœ… **Key Wireless Concepts Reviewed**
- **Speed/Bandwidth vs. Throughput:**
  - Bandwidth: Theoretical maximum speed.
  - Throughput: Actual speed of data transfer.
  - (Brief mention of speeds for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax, emphasizing real-world vs. theoretical).
- **Distance:** Range limitations of different Wi-Fi standards (e.g., N has better range than A/B/G; AC/AX offer higher speeds but not necessarily longer range than N).
- **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator):**
  - Measured from the client device (in dB, typically negative values).
  - Closer to 0 dB = stronger signal.
  - Good signal: -60 to -65 dB. Extremely weak: around -90 dB.
- **EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power):**
  - Maximum power radiated from the AP (measured in dBi).
  - Indicates signal strength from the AP's perspective.

âœ… **Topics Covered in this Section**
- Wireless Coverage Issues (physical obstructions, range limitations, AP positioning)
- Interference Issues (overlapping channels, electronic devices, physical barriers)
- Client Disassociation Issues (unexpected disconnects due to distance, power saving, congestion)
- Incorrect Wireless Configurations (mismatched security settings, incorrect SSIDs/channels)
- Captive Portal Issues (authentication problems, misconfigured access policies, timeouts)
- Other Wireless Considerations
