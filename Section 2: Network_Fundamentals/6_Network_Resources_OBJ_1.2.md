## ðŸ’¡ Network Resources (OBJ 1.2)

Network resources are managed through two main models. The benefits of one model are generally the drawbacks of the other; they are essentially opposites.

âœ… **1. Client-Server Model**
- Uses a **dedicated server** to provide access to resources (files, scanners, printers).
- **Benefits:**
  - **Centralized Administration:** Easier to manage and back up resources as they are on a central server.
  - **Easier Management:** Streamlined configuration and permission management.
  - **Better Scalability:** Can expand by adding more servers or using cloud architectures.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - **Higher Cost:** Requires dedicated hardware and specialized operating system software.
  - **Specialized Skillset:** Needs personnel with expertise to manage.
- **Usage:** Leading model for business networks due to its efficiency and control.

âœ… **2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model**
- Peers (individual machines like laptops, desktops) **share resources directly** with each other.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Low Cost:** No dedicated infrastructure, specialized hardware, or operating system software required.
  - **Easy to Start:** Simple to set up for small groups.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - **Decentralized Management:** Difficult administration and backup as files are spread across multiple machines.
  - **Inefficient for Large Networks:** Becomes a nightmare to manage as the number of machines grows.
  - **Poor Scalability:** Not suitable for large organizations.
  - **Availability Issues:** Resources are unavailable if the sharing machine is offline.
- **Usage:** More common in small, informal networks or for specific applications (e.g., file sharing where availability isn't critical).
