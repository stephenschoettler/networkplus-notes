## ðŸ’¡ Cellular Connections (OBJ 1.5)

Cellular connections provide wireless internet access through cellular networks. Common devices include smartphones, tablets, dedicated cellular modems, mobile hotspots, and fixed cellular home internet devices.
**General Rule:** Higher frequency band = Faster speeds, but smaller coverage area.

âœ… **Cellular Generations ("G")**
- Each "G" (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G) represents a new generation of cellular technology, generally bringing **faster speeds and increased capabilities**.
- **1G (1980s):** Analog, voice-only, very slow data (if any).
- **2G (Late 1990s):** Digital, introduced SMS/texting, basic data (dial-up speeds), international roaming.
- **3G:** Faster data speeds (up to 2 Mbps), introduced WCDMA, HSPA, HSPA+.
- **4G (LTE/LTE-A):** Significantly faster (up to 100 Mbps mobile, 1 Gbps fixed), introduced MIMO.
- **5G (Current):** The latest generation, offering even faster speeds and lower latency.

âœ… **5G Frequency Bands (Key Distinction)**
- 5G operates across three main frequency bands, each with different characteristics:
  - **1. Low Band (600-850 MHz):**
    - **Speed:** 30-250 Mbps.
    - **Coverage:** Long range, similar to older 4G networks.
    - **Use:** Wide area coverage.
  - **2. Mid Band (2.5-3.7 GHz):**
    - **Speed:** 100-900 Mbps.
    - **Coverage:** Good balance of speed and coverage, but less range than low band.
    - **Use:** Most common 5G deployment for general use.
  - **3. High Band (25-39 GHz / Millimeter Wave):**
    - **Speed:** Multi-Gigabit per second (up to 10 Gbps).
    - **Coverage:** Very short range, easily blocked by obstacles (walls, windows).
    - **Use:** Dense urban areas, sports stadiums, convention centers where high capacity is needed.

âœ… **Underlying Cellular Technologies: GSM vs. CDMA**
- Two primary technologies for cellular networks:
  - **1. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications):**
    - **Mechanism:** Uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and later Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) for digital voice and data.
    - **Prevalence:** More widely supported globally.
    - **SIM Card:** Uses a **Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card** to identify the user to the network. This allows for easy switching of carriers by changing the SIM card.
  - **2. CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access):**
    - **Mechanism:** Uses code division to split channels, encoding data with unique keys for each call.
    - **Prevalence:** Less globally prevalent than GSM (e.g., historically used by Verizon in the US).
    - **SIM Card:** Traditional CDMA phones do not use SIM cards; devices are often locked to the carrier.
    - **Modern Trend:** With 3G, 4G, and 5G, the technologies have converged, and many modern phones support both. GSM is still preferred for international travel due to wider support.

âœ… **Mobile Hotspots & Tethering**
- **Tethering:** Using a smartphone's cellular connection to provide internet access to other devices (via Wi-Fi, USB, or Bluetooth).
- **Dedicated Mobile Hotspots:** Portable devices that combine a cellular modem and a wireless access point to provide Wi-Fi internet access.
- **eSIMs:** Electronic SIMs allow users to download carrier profiles directly to their devices, making it easier to switch providers or get local service plans while traveling without a physical SIM card.
