âœ… **Top 5 Tips for Increasing Exam Score**
- **1. Use a cheat sheet (brain dump):** Write down important info (ports, protocols) on the provided whiteboard/digital whiteboard once the exam clock starts.
- **2. Skip the simulations (PBQs) first:** Mark them for review and complete multiple-choice questions first. Return to simulations at the end.
- **3. Take a guess:** No penalty for incorrect guesses. Eliminate choices and guess from remaining options.
- **4. Pick the best time of day:** Schedule the exam when you perform best (e.g., morning). Arrive early to relax.
- **5. Be confident:** Study thoroughly, use practice exams to build confidence. Understand *why* answers are correct/incorrect, not just memorizing.
