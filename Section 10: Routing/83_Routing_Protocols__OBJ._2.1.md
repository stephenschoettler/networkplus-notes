## ðŸ’¡ Routing Protocols (OBJ 2.1)

- Dynamic routing protocols allow routers to automatically learn and share routing information.
- They are categorized into Internal Gateway Protocols (IGP), which operate *within* an autonomous system.
- They are also categorized into External Gateway Protocols (EGP), which operate *between* autonomous systems.

âœ… **Dynamic Routing Protocol Types**
- **Distance Vector:**
  - Routers send a full copy of their routing table to directly connected neighbors at regular intervals.
  - Metric: Primarily **hop count** (number of routers to pass through).
  - Characterized by **slow convergence time** (time for all routers to update their tables after a topology change).
  - Can use **hold-down timers** to improve convergence by reducing update frequency.
- **Link State:**
  - Routers build a complete map of the network topology.
  - Metric: **Cost**, often based on **link speed/bandwidth**.
  - Characterized by **faster convergence time** than distance vector protocols.
  - Requires all routers to know about all paths and other routers.
- **Hybrid:** Combines aspects of both distance vector and link state.
- **Path Vector:** Used by EGPs, focuses on autonomous system hops rather than router hops.

âœ… **Specific Routing Protocols**
- **1. RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
  - **Type:** IGP
  - **Algorithm:** Distance Vector
  - **Metric:** Hop count
  - **Key Features:**
    - Oldest dynamic routing protocol.
    - Maximum 15 hops (16+ hops considered unreachable).
    - Updates every 30 seconds, leading to slow convergence.
    - Easy to configure.
    - Uses UDP for updates (fire-and-forget).
- **2. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
  - **Type:** IGP
  - **Algorithm:** Link State
  - **Metric:** Cost (based on link speed/bandwidth)
  - **Key Features:**
    - Very popular and widely used.
    - Faster convergence than RIP.
    - Routers build a synchronized view of the network.
- **3. IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)**
  - **Type:** IGP
  - **Algorithm:** Link State
  - **Metric:** Cost (based on link speed/bandwidth)
  - **Key Features:**
    - Functions similarly to OSPF but less widely adopted.
- **4. EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
  - **Type:** IGP
  - **Algorithm:** Advanced Distance Vector (Hybrid)
  - **Metric:** Bandwidth and Delay
  - **Key Features:**
    - Developed by Cisco (proprietary).
    - Popular in Cisco-only networks.
    - Combines benefits of distance vector and link state.
- **5. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
  - **Type:** EGP
  - **Algorithm:** Path Vector
  - **Metric:** Autonomous System (AS) hops
  - **Key Features:**
    - The backbone of the internet.
    - Used for routing between different ISPs and large networks.
    - Focuses on AS paths rather than individual router hops.
    - Can have slow convergence due to its large scale.
