## ðŸ’¡ Testing a Network (OBJ 5.5)

This section covers tools used for testing a network. If you see "fox and hound" or "toner probe" on the exam, think about using it for **cable distribution network troubleshooting** (finding breaks) or **identification and documentation** of network cables.

âœ… **Cable Tester**
- A device used to test network cables.
- Can be integrated with a "fox and hound" (toner probe).
- Tests pin-to-pin connectivity (e.g., pins 1 through 8).

âœ… **Fox and Hound (Toner Probe)**
- Also known as a **toner probe**.
- Consists of two parts: a **sender** (fox/toner) and a **probe** (hound).
- **Sender:** Plugs into a network jack and sends an audible signal (tone) through the cable.
- **Probe:** Used to trace the cable; it emits a noise that gets louder as it gets closer to the cable carrying the signal.
- **Purpose:**
  - **Identify and Document Cables:** Crucial for undocumented networks to determine which network jack connects to which port on a patch panel or switch.
  - **Troubleshoot Breaks:** Can help trace a cable to find where a break in the wire might be.

âœ… **Usage Scenario**
- 1. Plug the sender into the network jack in a room.
- 2. Go to the patch panel (or switch) in the server room.
- 3. Use the probe to touch individual cables or ports on the patch panel.
- 4. The probe will make a noise when it identifies the cable connected to the sender, allowing you to label it.
