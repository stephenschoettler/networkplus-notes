## ðŸ’¡ Step Four and Step Five (OBJ. 5.1)
This section combines steps four and five of the troubleshooting methodology: establishing a plan of action to resolve the problem and then implementing that solution or escalating as necessary.

âœ… **Step 4: Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects**
- Goal: Determine *how* to solve the identified problem.

âœ… **Options for Resolution**
- **Repair:** Fix existing component (consider cost-effectiveness).
- **Replace:** Substitute faulty component (often better for older devices).
- **Workaround:** Temporary solution to restore functionality (useful for critical, time-sensitive issues).

âœ… **Planning Considerations**
- **Resources:** Time, cost, personnel.
- **Impacts:** Identify potential effects on other users/systems (e.g., server reboots).
- **Authorization:** Seek permission based on organizational policies and change impact.
- **System Interdependencies:** Understand how changes affect other systems.

âœ… **Step 5: Implement the solution or escalate as necessary**
- Goal: Execute the plan of action.

âœ… **Implementation**
- Carry out the planned solution (e.g., install update, replace hardware).
- **Adhere strictly to the plan.** Deviations require re-authorization.
- **Escalate** if lacking authority or resources.
