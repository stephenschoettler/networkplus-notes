## ðŸ’¡ Malware Attacks (OBJ 4.2)

Malware (Malicious Software) is software designed to infiltrate a computer system and potentially damage it without the user's knowledge or consent.

âœ… **Types of Malware**
- **1. Virus:**
  - **Mechanism:** Malicious code that infects a computer when a user runs an infected program or opens an infected file. Requires user action to spread.
  - **Impact:** Replicates and attempts to spread to other systems.
- **2. Worm:**
  - **Mechanism:** Self-replicating malicious software that spreads without user interaction. Exploits security vulnerabilities.
  - **Impact:** Consumes network resources, leading to slowdowns/crashes. Spreads rapidly (e.g., Nimda, Conficker). Often used to build botnets.
- **3. Trojan Horse:**
  - **Mechanism:** Malicious code disguised as harmless or desirable software. Performs its intended function but also carries out a malicious function in the background.
  - **RAT (Remote Access Trojan):** Common type of Trojan providing remote control.
- **4. Ransomware:**
  - **Mechanism:** Restricts access to a victim's system/files (e.g., by encrypting files) until a ransom is paid.
  - **Impact:** Data inaccessibility, significant financial cost.
  - **Defense:** Restore from offline backups.
- **5. Spyware:**
  - **Mechanism:** Gathers information about the user without consent.
  - **Types:** Adware (for ads), Keylogger (captures keystrokes).
  - **Impact:** Privacy invasion, data theft.
- **6. Rootkit:**
  - **Mechanism:** Gains administrative-level control over a system/device while remaining undetected. Often compromises firmware.
  - **Impact:** Highest level of control for attacker; extremely difficult to detect (loads before OS).
  - **Detection:** Boot from external device and scan.
