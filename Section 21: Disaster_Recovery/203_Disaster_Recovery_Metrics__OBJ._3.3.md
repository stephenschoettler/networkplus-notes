## ðŸ’¡ Disaster Recovery Metrics (OBJ. 3.3)
This section defines key disaster recovery metrics such as Availability, Reliability, MTTR, MTBF, MTD, RTO, and RPO, explaining their importance in planning and evaluating IT recovery capabilities.

âœ… **Disaster Recovery Metrics**
- Quantifiable standards to plan and evaluate IT recovery capabilities.

âœ… **Availability**
- Measured in uptime (e.g., 99.999% = "Five Nines" = 5 min downtime/year).
- Achieved through highly available and reliable network design.

âœ… **Reliability**
- Network's ability to pass data without dropping packets.
- Both high availability and high reliability are crucial.

âœ… **Key Disaster Recovery Metrics**
- **1. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR):**
  - Average time to repair a broken device.
  - Goal: Low number (faster repairs).
- **2. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):**
  - Average time between device failures.
  - Goal: High number (more reliable equipment).
- **3. Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD):**
  - Longest period a business can be inoperable without irreversible failure.
  - Determined by business needs.
- **4. Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**
  - Time to resume normal business operations after an event.
  - Focus: Speed of service restoration.
- **5. Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**
  - Longest period of time an organization can tolerate lost data.
  - Determined by backup frequency (e.g., 6-hour RPO means backups every 6 hours).
