## ðŸ’¡ Wireless Coverage Issues (OBJ. 5.4)
This section addresses common wireless coverage issues, including insufficient signal strength and dead zones, and explores various solutions to extend and optimize wireless network coverage.

âœ… **Wireless Coverage Issues**
- **Wireless Coverage:** The physical area around a wireless transmitter where there is sufficient signal strength for a wireless device to operate.
- **Measurement:**
  - **RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator):** Measured from the client device (in decibels, more negative = weaker).
  - **EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power):** Measured from the Access Point (AP) (in dBi).
  - **Site Surveys:** Generate heat maps to visualize signal strength (green = strong, red = weak).

âœ… **Insufficient Wireless Coverage Issues**
- **Problem:** Wireless signal is too weak in certain areas.
- **Causes:**
  - **Distance:** Signal strength decreases with distance from the AP.
  - **Physical Obstacles:** Walls, floors, and other building materials attenuate the signal.
- **Symptoms:** Low RSSI, intermittent connectivity, dropped connections, inability to connect.

âœ… **Solutions to Extend Wireless Coverage**
- **1. Signal Boosters:** Increase the power of the transmitted signal.
- **2. Stronger Antennas:** Use antennas with a higher dBi rating (e.g., replacing a 5 dBi antenna with a 9 dBi antenna can double the range under ideal conditions).
- **3. Wireless Repeaters:**
  - A Layer 1 device with two radios.
  - Receives a weak signal, boosts it, and retransmits it at full strength.
  - Extends coverage into additional areas.
- **4. Extended Service Set (ESS) / Multiple Access Points (APs):**
  - Deploy multiple APs throughout the coverage area.
  - APs are typically connected via wired Ethernet backhaul.
  - Each AP operates on a different non-overlapping channel (e.g., 1, 6, 11 in 2.4 GHz) to minimize interference.
  - Allows seamless roaming between APs.
- **5. Wireless Mesh Systems:**
  - Combine repeaters and APs into a single device.
  - Rely on internal wireless radios for backhaul between mesh nodes (no need for wired Ethernet to each node).
  - Provides full-house coverage for larger homes/offices.
