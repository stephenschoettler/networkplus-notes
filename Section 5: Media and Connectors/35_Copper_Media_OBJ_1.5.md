## ðŸ’¡ Copper Media (OBJ 1.5)

Copper media is a fundamental part of network infrastructure, offering versatility and robustness at a lower cost and easier installation compared to fiber. All CAT cables are generally limited to 100 meters, except CAT 6 (55 meters for 10 Gbps) and CAT 8 (30 meters for 25-40 Gbps). Speeds generally increase by a factor of 10 as you go up categories.

âœ… **IEEE 802.3 Standard**
- A collection of standards defining the physical and data link layers for wired Ethernet networks.

âœ… **Twisted Pair Cables**
- Two conductors twisted together to cancel out EMI and crosstalk.
- Used for data and voice signals.
- **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):**
  - Most common type.
  - No additional shielding.
  - Lightweight, flexible, cost-effective.
  - Smaller diameter, easier to install.
  - More susceptible to EMI and noise.
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):**
  - Designed with a layer of insulation/shielding (copper tape, polymer, or braided mesh).
  - Better protection against EMI and crosstalk.
  - More expensive, bulkier, and more difficult to install.

âœ… **Twisted Pair Cable Categories (CAT)**
- **CAT 5:** 100 Mbps up to 100 meters (100 MHz frequency). Also called 100BASE-T or Fast Ethernet.
- **CAT 5e (Enhanced):** 1 Gbps up to 100 meters (100 MHz frequency). More twists than CAT 5 to reduce crosstalk. Also called 1000BASE-T or Gigabit Ethernet.
- **CAT 6:** 1 Gbps up to 100 meters (250 MHz frequency). Can support 10 Gbps up to 55 meters.
- **CAT 6a (Augmented):** 10 Gbps up to 100 meters (500 MHz frequency). Improved crosstalk protection over CAT 6. Also called 10GBASE-T or 10 Gigabit Ethernet.
- **CAT 7:** (Not TIA/EIA recognized, but exists) 10 Gbps up to 100 meters (600 MHz frequency).
- **CAT 8:** 25-40 Gbps up to 30 meters (2000 MHz/2 GHz frequency). Designed for data centers for high-speed, short-distance connections.

âœ… **Coaxial Cables**
- Single copper conductor at core, insulating layer, conductive shield, outer jacket.
- Used in broadband systems (cable TV, internet).
- **RG-6:** Modern standard. Heavier copper core, better for high bandwidth/frequency (e.g., cable modems, digital video). Supports up to 1 Gbps at ~300 meters.
- **RG-59:** Older standard. Thinner copper core, lower bandwidth/frequency. Used in analog video and CCTV.

âœ… **Specialized Coaxial Cables**
- **Direct Attach Copper (DAC) Cables:**
  - Fixed assembly copper cabling with pre-attached connectors.
  - Used for short-distance connections within server racks in data centers (switches, routers, firewalls, servers).
  - Cost-effective, reduced power consumption compared to fiber for short distances.
  - Supports up to 100 Gbps (15m for active, 7m for passive).
- **Twinaxial (Twinax) Cables:**
  - Often a component of DAC assemblies.
  - Two separate insulated copper conductors run parallel within the same outer shield.
  - Optimized for short-range, high-speed differential signaling.
  - Less susceptible to EMI than unshielded cables.
  - Supports 10, 25, 40, or 100 Gbps (distances vary, e.g., 100m for 10 Gbps, 7m for 100 Gbps).

âœ… **Plenum vs. Non-Plenum Cables**
- **Plenum Cables:**
  - Fire-retardant plastic jackets (PVC, FEP).
  - Prevent flame spread, reduce smoke.
  - Required for **plenum spaces** (areas used for air circulation in HVAC systems) due to fire safety standards (NFPA, NEC).
  - More expensive.
- **Non-Plenum Cables:**
  - Less expensive jacket materials, not fire-retardant.
  - Produce more smoke and toxic fumes when burned.
  - Used in spaces without environmental air return (e.g., inside walls, conduit).
  - More cost-effective for installations not requiring stringent fire safety.
