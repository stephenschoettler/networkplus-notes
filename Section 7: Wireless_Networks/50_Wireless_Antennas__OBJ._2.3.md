## ðŸ’¡ Wireless Antennas (OBJ 2.3)

Wireless Antennas convert electrical signals into radio waves for transmission and vice versa for reception. Antenna Gain is a measure of how efficiently an antenna converts electrical power into radio waves in a specific direction. Measured in dBi (decibels relative to an isotropic radiator) or dBd (decibels relative to a dipole antenna). Higher gain means a more focused signal and longer range, but a narrower beam. Remember that omnidirectional antennas provide wide, general coverage, while unidirectional antennas provide focused, long-range coverage.

âœ… **Types of Wireless Antennas**
- **1. Omnidirectional Antenna:**
  - **Radiation Pattern:** Spreads radio waves equally in all directions (like a donut shape).
  - **Gain:** Low gain.
  - **Usage:** Common in homes and small offices for general Wi-Fi coverage. Ideal for covering a wide area where clients are scattered around the access point.
  - **Examples:** Dipole antennas (rubber ducky antennas on Wi-Fi routers), ceiling-mounted access points.
- **2. Unidirectional Antenna:**
  - **Radiation Pattern:** Focuses radio waves in a specific direction (like a flashlight beam).
  - **Gain:** High gain.
  - **Usage:** Used for point-to-point connections (e.g., linking two buildings) or for covering a specific, narrow area.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Yagi Antenna:** Highly directional, often used for long-distance outdoor Wi-Fi links or TV antennas.
    - **Dish Antenna:** Very high gain, used for extremely long-distance point-to-point links (e.g., satellite communication, microwave links).
    - **Sector Antenna:** A type of directional antenna that provides a wide, pie-shaped coverage area (e.g., 60, 90, or 120 degrees). Often used in cellular towers to cover a specific sector of a cell.
