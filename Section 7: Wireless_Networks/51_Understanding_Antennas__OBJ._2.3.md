## ðŸ’¡ Understanding Antennas (OBJ 2.3)

This lesson provides a hands-on look at different antenna types and their physical characteristics. For the exam, remember: **Omni (All Directions):** Use for general, centralized coverage (e.g., a WAP in the middle of a room). **Uni (One Direction):** Use for focused, long-distance links (e.g., connecting two buildings). **Yagi & Parabolic:** Specific types of unidirectional antennas for very long-distance, highly focused applications.

âœ… **Antenna Types and Examples**
- **1. Omnidirectional Antennas:**
  - **Signal Pattern:** Radiates signal equally in all directions (360 degrees).
  - **Visuals:**
    - **Internal:** Found inside devices like cell phones and many modern wireless access points (WAPs).
    - **External (Whip):** The common "stick" antennas seen on routers and wireless cards.
  - **Key Point:** Longer omnidirectional antennas generally provide better signal propagation and range.
  - **Use Case:** General coverage in a room or open area where clients are in all directions.
- **2. Unidirectional Antennas:**
  - **Signal Pattern:** Focuses the signal's power in a single, specific direction.
  - **Use Case:** Point-to-point links between buildings or when targeting a specific coverage area.
- **3. Parabolic Antennas:**
  - **Concept:** A specific type of unidirectional antenna.
  - **Visuals:** Characterized by a curved dish shape.
  - **Use Case:** Commonly used for satellite TV and long-distance microwave links, where the dish focuses the signal to/from a single point in the sky.
- **4. Yagi Antennas:**
  - **Concept:** Another specific type of unidirectional antenna.
  - **Visuals:** Has a distinct, arrow-like appearance with multiple parallel elements.
  - **Use Case:** Excellent for long-distance, fixed, point-to-point connections (e.g., building-to-building links, connecting to a distant TV transmitter).
