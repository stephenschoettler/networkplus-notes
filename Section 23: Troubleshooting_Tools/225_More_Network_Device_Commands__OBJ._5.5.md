âœ… **More Network Device Commands**
- Essential commands for troubleshooting and managing network devices, primarily on Cisco switches.

âœ… **`show MAC address table`**
- Purpose: Displays the MAC address table on a switch.
- Function: Maps MAC addresses to the switch ports they are connected to.
- Use: Identify devices on specific ports, troubleshoot connectivity.
- Output Columns: VLAN/BID, MAC Address, Type (e.g., dynamic), Port.

âœ… **`show ARP`**
- Purpose: Displays the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table.
- Function: Shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses.
- Use: Verify correct IP-to-MAC mappings, detect ARP cache poisoning/spoofing.
- Output Columns: Protocol, Address (IP), Age, Hardware Address (MAC), Type (e.g., ARPA), Interface.

âœ… **`show VLAN`**
- Purpose: Displays VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) settings on a switch.
- Function: Shows VLAN configurations, including VLAN ID, name, status, and associated ports.
- Use: Verify network segmentation, troubleshoot VLAN connectivity issues.
- Output Columns: VLAN ID, Name, Status (active/inactive), Ports.
- **Exam Tip:** Change default VLAN 1 to a less guessable ID for security.

âœ… **`show power`**
- Purpose: Displays and configures Power over Ethernet (PoE) settings.
- Function: Shows power allocated, used, and available per port for PoE devices.
- Use: Manage power distribution, troubleshoot PoE issues (e.g., devices not powering on).
- Output Columns: Interface, Admin (auto/manual), Oper (on/off), Power (watts), Device, Class (PoE class), Max (max power supported).
