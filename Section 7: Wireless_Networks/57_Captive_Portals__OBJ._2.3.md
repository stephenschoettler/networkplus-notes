## ðŸ’¡ Captive Portals (OBJ 2.3)

A **Captive Portal** is a web page that is displayed to newly connected users of a Wi-Fi or wired network before they are granted broader access to network resources. It intercepts the user's network connection and redirects them to a special web page. Common use cases include public networks in hotels, airports, coffee shops, and business guest networks.

âœ… **Key Functions of Captive Portals**
- **1. User Authentication:**
  - **Purpose:** To control access to the network.
  - **Methods:** Requires users to enter login credentials, provide an access code, or use other authentication methods.
- **2. Policy Acceptance:**
  - **Purpose:** To ensure legal protection for the organization and inform users of the rules.
  - **Method:** Requires users to agree to a Terms of Service (ToS) or Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) before accessing the network.
- **3. Data Collection:**
  - **Purpose:** Often used for marketing.
  - **Method:** Collects user data, such as an email address, in exchange for network access. This can be used to send promotional materials or offers.

âœ… **Captive Portals and Guest Networks**
- Captive portals are an integral part of guest networks, providing a secure way to manage visitor access without exposing the main corporate network.
- They offer an opportunity for branding by allowing businesses to customize the login page with their logo and other information.

âœ… **Best Practices for Implementation**
- **Ease of Use:** The portal should be easy to navigate with clear instructions and a straightforward authentication process.
- **Legal Compliance:** Must comply with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) if collecting personal information.
- **Testing:** Test the portal across various devices and browsers to ensure it functions correctly for all users.
