## ðŸ’¡ Cable (DOCSIS) Connections (OBJ 1.5)

Cable connections deliver high-speed internet to homes and offices using the same lines as cable television.

âœ… **Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC) Network**
- **Concept:** The backbone of cable internet, combining fiber optic and coaxial cables.
- **Fiber Optic:** Used for longer distances, typically from the service provider's facility to a distribution point near the user's home.
- **Coaxial Cable:** Completes the "last mile" journey from the distribution point directly into the home or office.
- **Benefit:** Ensures robust and efficient delivery of high-volume data by leveraging the strengths of both cable types.

âœ… **DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)**
- **Purpose:** A suite of specifications that standardizes how data is transmitted over HFC networks.
- **Importance:** Ensures interoperability between cable modems and cable internet providers, leading to consistent, reliable, and high-speed internet access.
- **Frequency Ranges:** DOCSIS designates specific frequency ranges for data transmission:
  - **Upstream (Uploads):** Data sent from your home (e.g., emails, uploaded files) typically uses a range like 5-42 MHz.
  - **Downstream (Downloads):** Data received by your home (e.g., streaming video, websites) typically operates between 50-860 MHz.
- **Asynchronous Speeds (Common in Cable):** Cable modem connections are almost always **asynchronous**, meaning download speeds are significantly higher than upload speeds. This is due to the much larger bandwidth allocated for downstream traffic compared to upstream traffic in the DOCSIS standard.

âœ… **Advantages of Cable Internet**
- **Leverages Existing Infrastructure:** Utilizes the widespread cable TV network, making deployment cost-effective and quick.
- **Higher Speeds:** Historically offered much faster speeds than older technologies like DSL, making it a popular choice for broadband internet.
- **Evolution:** Multiple DOCSIS versions (e.g., 1.0 to current) have continuously improved speed, efficiency, and security, supporting speeds up to 1 Gbps or more.
