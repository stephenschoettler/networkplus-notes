## ðŸ’¡ Network Fundamentals

This section covers the fundamental concepts of computer networks.

âœ… **Computer Networks**
- Connect diverse devices to facilitate seamless data flow (wired: Ethernet, fiber optic; wireless: Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth).

âœ… **Converged Networks**
- Modern networks unify voice, data, and video over a single connection (e.g., smartphones handle calls, texts, browsing, streaming as digital data).

âœ… **High Availability & Uptime**
- Crucial for networks.
- **Five-nines (99.999%) availability:** Allows only about five minutes of downtime per year.
- Network technicians must maintain continuous operations.

âœ… **Network Fundamentals Section Focus (CompTIA Network+ N10-009)**
- **Domain 1: Networking Concepts**
  - Objective 1.2: Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
  - Objective 1.6: Compare and contrast network topologies, architectures, and types.
- **Domain 2: Network Implementation**
  - Objective 2.3: Select and configure wireless devices and technologies.

âœ… **Topics Covered in this Section**
- Network components (clients, servers, hubs, switches, WAPs, routers, firewalls, load balancers, proxies, IDS/IPS).
- Network resources (client-server vs. peer-to-peer models).
- Network geography (PAN, LAN, CAN, MAN, WAN).
- Wired network topologies (point-to-point, ring, bus, star, hub and spoke, mesh).
- Wireless topologies (ad hoc, infrastructure mode, wireless mesh).
- Datacenter topologies (three-tiered, collapsed core, spine and leaf, traffic flows).
