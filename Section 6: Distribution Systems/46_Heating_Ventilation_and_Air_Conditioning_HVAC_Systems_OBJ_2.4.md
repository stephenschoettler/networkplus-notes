## ðŸ’¡ Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems (OBJ 2.4)

HVAC Systems are essential for maintaining optimal environmental conditions for network hardware and devices in data centers. Proper HVAC design (temperature, humidity, airflow) is crucial during data center planning to protect investments, ensure uninterrupted operation, and optimize performance. Retrofitting is difficult and costly.

âœ… **1. Temperature Control**
- Electronic equipment generates heat; without proper cooling, temperatures rise, leading to hardware malfunctions and reduced efficiency.
- Devices may power down prematurely to prevent damage from overheating, causing network downtime.
- **Recommended Temperature:** Typically 68-77Â°F (20-25Â°C) for peak efficiency. Always check manufacturer recommendations.

âœ… **2. Humidity Levels**
- **Too much humidity:** Can lead to condensation, causing corrosion or electrical shorts.
- **Too little humidity:** Creates an environment prone to static electrical charges, potentially damaging sensitive electronics.
- **Recommended Humidity:** Maintain a relative humidity level of 40-60% to prevent both issues.

âœ… **3. Airflow Management**
- Manages and dissipates heat generated by equipment.
- **Port-side Exhaust and Intake (Hot Aisle/Cold Aisle Configuration):**
  - Strategic method of air distribution.
  - **Cold Aisle:** All cold air intakes of server racks face one aisle.
  - **Hot Aisle:** All hot air exhausts face the opposite aisle.
  - **Benefits:** Maximizes cooling efficiency by directing cold air to intakes and pulling hot air away, preventing mixing of air streams. Significantly reduces energy consumption.
- **Raised-floor systems:** Allow cold air to be pushed upward into racks.
- **Ceiling plenums:** Configured to return hot air back out of the data center.
