## ðŸ’¡ Integrations and APIs (OBJ 1.8)

**Integration** is combining different subsystems into one comprehensive system. An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules/protocols allowing software to "talk" to each other. Both are fundamental for automation, orchestration, efficiency, and scalability.

âœ… **Common API Communication Styles**
- **1. REST (Representational State Transfer):**
  - Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
  - Stateless, typically uses JSON.
  - **Pros:** Lightweight, straightforward, easily integrated.
- **2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**
  - Strict standard, usually XML format (header + body).
  - **Pros:** More robust, enhanced security, transaction compliance.
  - **Cons:** More complex, heavier.

âœ… **APIs in Practice**
- Enable seamless communication between diverse services (especially cloud-based).
- Automate administration, management, monitoring.
- Facilitate microservice architectures (calling external functions instead of building them).
- Create seamless user experiences by integrating third-party tools (e.g., launching labs directly).
