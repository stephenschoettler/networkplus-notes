## ðŸ’¡ Fire Suppression Systems (OBJ 2.4)

This section covers fire suppression systems. Design data centers with clean agent systems to prevent water damage to equipment. Fire suppression systems should be installed properly by professionals and inspected annually.

âœ… **Wet Pipe Systems**
- Most basic type, pipes always contain water.
- Valve opens and water is released when fire alarm goes off.
- **Risk:** Accidental leaks or broken bulbs can damage servers/network gear with water.
- Generally **avoid** in data centers.

âœ… **Pre-action Systems**
- Minimizes risk of accidental water release compared to wet pipe.
- Requires **two conditions** to be tripped before water release: a detector (e.g., smoke detector) and a sprinkler.
- Still uses water, so generally **not ideal** for data centers.

âœ… **Special Suppression Systems (Clean Agent Systems)**
- Utilize a **clean agent** (halocarbon or inert gas).
- **Mechanism:** Displaces oxygen in the room, suffocating the fire.
- **Danger:** Can suffocate personnel in the data center.
- **Safety Measures:**
  - Must have an **alarm** announcing clean agent release.
  - Must have **supplemental oxygen** available for personnel.
