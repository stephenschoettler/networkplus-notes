## ðŸ’¡ Satellite Connections (OBJ 1.5)

Satellite connections are an internet access method using communication satellites in space to connect users to the internet. They are ideal for remote or mobile areas where traditional internet options (cable, fiber, cellular) are unavailable (e.g., rural homes, RVs, ships, airplanes). While traditional satellite internet (GEO) offers widespread availability but suffers from high latency, newer LEO satellite constellations (like Starlink) provide a game-changer with much lower latency, making satellite internet a more viable option for a wider range of users and applications.

âœ… **General Characteristics of Satellite Internet**
- **Advantages:**
  - **Ubiquity:** Available almost anywhere with a clear line of sight to the sky.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Cost:** Generally more expensive than equivalent terrestrial services.
  - **Speed:** Often not as fast as fiber or most cable modems.
  - **Latency (Lag):** A significant drawback, especially with traditional GEO satellites.

âœ… **Types of Communication Satellites**
- **1. Geosynchronous (GEO) Satellites:**
  - **Altitude:** Located at a very high altitude (~22,000 miles / 35,786 km) above the Earth.
  - **Coverage:** A few GEO satellites (3-6) can cover most of the Earth's surface.
  - **Latency:** High latency (~500 milliseconds round trip) due to the long distance the signal must travel to space and back. This makes real-time applications like online gaming problematic.
- **2. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites (e.g., Starlink):**
  - **Altitude:** Located at much lower altitudes (~340 miles / 550 km) above the Earth.
  - **Coverage:** Each LEO satellite covers a much smaller area, requiring thousands of satellites for global coverage (e.g., Starlink aims for 12,000+).
  - **Latency:** Significantly lower latency (e.g., 25-35 milliseconds for Starlink) due to the shorter distance. This makes LEO satellite internet much more suitable for latency-sensitive applications.
  - **Cost:** Often a more affordable option than traditional satellite services.
