## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting Physical Networks (OBJ. 5.2)
This section focuses on identifying and resolving common problems in physical network infrastructure, aligning with Objective 5.2 of the Network+ exam.

âœ… **Troubleshooting Physical Networks**
- Focus: Effectively pinpointing and fixing physical network problems.
- CompTIA Network+ Objective 5.2: Given a scenario, troubleshoot common cabling and physical interface issues.

âœ… **Topics Covered in this Section**
- **Network Cable Limitations:** Factors like cable length, type, and quality that restrict bandwidth and affect performance.
- **Cable Signal Issues:** Causes of signal degradation (e.g., interference, attenuation) compromising data transmission.
- **Copper Cable Issues:** Susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI), physical damage, and corrosion leading to connectivity problems.
- **Fiber Cable Issues:** Challenges specific to fiber cables, including bending, dirty connectors, and splicing errors disrupting light signals.
- **Ethernet Issues:** Common Ethernet problems like auto-negotiation misconfigurations and collision domains impeding network traffic.
- **Interface Issues:** How incorrect settings or faulty interfaces on network devices can cause packet loss, errors, and connectivity issues.
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE) Issues:** Complexities of delivering power alongside data on the same cable, potentially leading to equipment malfunctions.
