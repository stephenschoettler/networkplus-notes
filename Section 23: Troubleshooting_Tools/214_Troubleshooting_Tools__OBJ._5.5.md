## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting Tools (OBJ. 5.5)
This section provides an overview of essential hardware and software tools, along with command-line utilities and network device commands, used by network administrators to diagnose and resolve network problems, aligning with CompTIA Objective 5.5.

âœ… **Troubleshooting Tools**
- Purpose: Essential instruments for network administrators to diagnose and resolve network problems.
- CompTIA Objective 5.5: Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool or protocol to solve networking issues.

âœ… **Categories of Tools Covered in this Section**
- **Hardware Tools:** Physical tools for cabling, testing, and diagnostics (e.g., crimpers, cable testers, TDRs).
- **Software Tools:** Applications for network analysis, monitoring, and testing (e.g., Wi-Fi analyzers, packet captures, speed tests, port scanners, NetFlow analyzers, IP scanners).
- **Command-Line Tools (Client-side):**
  - `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `ip`: For IP configuration and interface management.
  - `ping`, `traceroute`, `tracert`: For connectivity and path mapping.
  - `nslookup`, `dig`: For DNS lookups and troubleshooting.
  - `arp`: For ARP cache management (IP to MAC mappings).
  - `netstat`: For network statistics and connection monitoring.
  - `tcpdump`: For in-depth packet analysis.
  - `nmap`: For network scanning, device/service discovery, and security auditing.
- **Network Device Commands:**
  - Basic: `show config`, `show interface`, `show route`.
  - More: `show mac address table`, `show arp`, `show vlan`, `show power`.
- **Discovery Protocol Tools:**
  - LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol).
  - CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol).
