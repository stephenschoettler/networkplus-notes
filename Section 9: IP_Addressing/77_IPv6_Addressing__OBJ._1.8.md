## ðŸ’¡ IPv6 Addressing (OBJ 1.8)

IPv4's 32-bit address space (approx. 4.3 billion addresses) led to address exhaustion. IPv6 solves this with a 128-bit address space (approx. 340 undecillion addresses), providing a vast number of unique IPs. IPv5 was an experimental protocol, never widely adopted.

âœ… **Benefits of IPv6**
- **Massive Address Space:** Solves IPv4 exhaustion.
- **No Broadcasts:** Improves network efficiency by removing the broadcast data flow type.
- **No Packet Fragmentation:** Enhances security and efficiency; packets are not broken down and reassembled.
- **Simplified Header:** Fewer fields (5 vs. 12 in IPv4) for faster processing by routers.

âœ… **IPv6 Address Format**
- **Length:** 128 bits.
- **Notation:** Uses **hexadecimal digits** (0-9, A-F).
- **Structure:** Divided into 8 segments (or "hextets") of 4 hexadecimal digits each, separated by colons.
- Each hex digit = 4 bits.
- Each segment = 16 bits.

âœ… **IPv6 Shorthand Notation (Crucial for Exam!)**
- **1. Omit Leading Zeros:** Within any 16-bit segment, leading zeros can be removed.
  - Example: `001A` becomes `1A`; `0000` becomes `0`.
- **2. Zero Compression (Double Colon `::`):** A single contiguous sequence of one or more `0` segments can be replaced by a double colon `::`.
  - **Rule:** The `::` can be used **only once** per IPv6 address.
  - Example: `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab` can be shortened to `2001:0db8::1428:57ab`.

âœ… **Identifying IPv6 vs. IPv4 vs. MAC Addresses**
- **IPv4:** Uses **dotted decimal** notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1`). Contains only numbers (0-255) and dots. No letters A-F, no colons.
- **IPv6:** Uses **hexadecimal digits** (0-9, A-F) and **colons**. Segments are typically 4 hex digits (or fewer with leading zero omission). May contain a `::`.
- **MAC Address:** 12 **hexadecimal digits**, typically grouped in pairs of two, separated by colons or hyphens (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).

âœ… **IPv6 Address Types**
- A single network interface can have multiple IPv6 addresses of different types.
- **1. Unicast:** One-to-one communication (a single sender to a single receiver).
  - **Globally-Routed Unicast:** Publicly routable on the internet. Similar to public IPv4 addresses.
  - Starts with `2000::/3` (i.e., first segment is `2000` to `3FFF`).
  - **Link-Local Unicast:** Used only for communication within the local network segment. Not routable. Automatically generated by the system.
  - Always starts with `FE80::/10`.
- **2. Multicast:** One-to-many communication (a single sender to a group of receivers).
  - Always starts with `FF00::/8`.
- **3. Anycast:** One-to-nearest communication (a single sender to the topologically closest member of a group of interfaces).
  - Allocated from the unicast address space, so you cannot identify an Anycast address just by looking at its format.

âœ… **Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) & EUI-64**
- **SLAAC:** An IPv6 mechanism allowing devices to automatically configure their own IP addresses without a DHCP server.
- **EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier-64):** A process used by SLAAC to generate a unique 64-bit interface identifier (the host portion of the IPv6 address) from a device's 48-bit MAC address.
- It inserts `FFFE` in the middle of the MAC address and flips the 7th bit.
- **DHCPv6:** While SLAAC is common, DHCPv6 can still be used to assign IPv6 addresses and other configuration information if centralized management is desired.

âœ… **Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)**
- **Purpose:** A core IPv6 protocol that replaces IPv4's ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and some ICMP functions.
- **Functions:**
  - **Router Solicitation (RS):** Hosts send RS messages to find routers on the network.
  - **Router Advertisement (RA):** Routers send RA messages to announce their presence and provide network configuration information.
  - **Neighbor Solicitation (NS)::** Hosts send NS messages to determine the link-layer (MAC) address of a neighbor or to verify neighbor reachability.
  - **Neighbor Advertisement (NA):** Neighbors send NA messages in response to NS or to announce their own link-layer address changes.
  - **Redirection:** Routers can inform hosts of a better first-hop router for a specific destination.
- **Benefit:** Automates many Layer 2 and Layer 3 discovery processes in IPv6.
