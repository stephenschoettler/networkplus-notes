## ðŸ’¡ Understanding Malware Attacks (OBJ 4.2)

This section provides a demonstration of malware attacks, showing the effects of a virus or Trojan once a system is compromised. Note that the demonstration uses older, vulnerable systems; modern systems have better defenses.

âœ… **Simple Virus Demonstration (e.g., "Crazy Mouse")**
- **Creation:** Uses a tool to generate a simple virus.
- **Infection Method (Conceptual):** Social engineering, binding to other programs, phishing.
- **Effect:** Causes a nuisance (e.g., erratic mouse movement), making the system unusable.

âœ… **Remote Access Trojan (RAT) Demonstration (e.g., ProRat)**
- **Creation:** Generates a "server" component (the RAT) with configurable options (port, password, error messages, self-deletion, disabling AV/firewall).
- **Infection Method (Conceptual):** Binding the RAT to a seemingly innocuous file (e.g., JPEG) and tricking the user into running it.
- **Attacker Capabilities (via RAT):** Once installed and connected, the attacker gains extensive remote control over the victim's machine. This includes:
  - Information Gathering: System info, user details, browsing history.
  - Monitoring: Screenshots, webcam viewing.
  - Interaction: Sending messages.
  - File Manipulation: Accessing, downloading, uploading files.
  - System Control: Manipulating registry, desktop icons, screen orientation, mouse.
  - Persistence: Designed to maintain connection.

âœ… **Key Takeaway**
- Malware, especially RATs, can give attackers significant control over compromised systems, enabling data theft, system disruption, and further malicious activities.
