## ðŸ’¡ Network Performance Issues (OBJ. 5.4)
This section details common causes of network performance issues, including high CPU usage, high bandwidth usage, poor physical connectivity, malfunctioning network devices, and DNS problems.

âœ… **Five Common Causes of Network Performance Issues**
- **1. High CPU Usage in Network Devices**
  - Network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) are computers with CPUs.
  - High CPU utilization leads to slowing down of the device and network.
  - **Symptoms:** Increased latency, jitter, packet loss.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Upgrade to more powerful devices.
    - Simplify processing load (e.g., optimize ACLs).
- **2. High Bandwidth Usage**
  - When bandwidth is high, communications wait, buffers fill, packets can be dropped.
  - Dropped TCP packets are retransmitted, further increasing utilization.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Increase bandwidth size (e.g., pay more to ISP).
    - Perform network flow analysis to identify and manage excessive/unnecessary traffic (e.g., social media).
- **3. Poor Physical Connectivity**
  - Damaged cables can still operate but cause errors and retransmissions, slowing down the network.
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - Check and test cables one by one.
    - If ISP issue suspected, connect test client directly to demarcation point.
    - Use cable testers for twisted pair and fiber light meters for fiber optic connections.
- **4. Malfunctioning Network Devices**
  - **Causes:** Misconfigurations, hardware failures, old/outdated network operating systems.
  - **Troubleshooting:** Use a systematic troubleshooting method (e.g., 7-step method) to pinpoint the device and determine if it's a configuration or hardware issue.
- **5. DNS Problems**
  - High DNS latency slows down user experience as domain name resolution is a prerequisite for accessing websites.
