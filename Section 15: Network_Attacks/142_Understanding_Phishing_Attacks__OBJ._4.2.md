## ðŸ’¡ Understanding Phishing Attacks (OBJ 4.2)

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information or installing malware by impersonating a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.

âœ… **Mechanism**
- Attackers create deceptive emails/messages that appear legitimate (e.g., from LinkedIn, a bank).
- These messages contain malicious links or attachments.
- When clicked, links lead to fake websites designed to steal credentials or download malware.
- Attackers often use subtle misspellings in sender addresses or URLs to evade detection.

âœ… **Defense Against Phishing**
- **1. User Training and Awareness:**
  - **Crucial:** Train users to identify phishing attempts (scrutinize sender, subject, hover over links).
  - **Emphasize:** Do NOT click links in suspicious emails.
- **2. Verification Best Practice:**
  - If suspicious email asks for action, open a new browser, type the legitimate website's URL directly, and log in there to verify.
- **3. Technical Controls:**
  - Email filters, spam blockers, antivirus software, web filters.
