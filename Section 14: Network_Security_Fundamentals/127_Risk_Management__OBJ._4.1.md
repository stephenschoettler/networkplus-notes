## ðŸ’¡ Risk Management (OBJ 4.1)

Risk exists where threats and vulnerabilities intersect. Risk Management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks, followed by the allocation of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of a vulnerability being exploited by a threat.

âœ… **Risk Assessment**
- **Purpose:** Identify potential hazards and analyze what could happen if a hazard occurs. Determines possible incidents, their likelihood, and consequences, and an organization's tolerance for such events.
- **Types of Risk Assessments:**
  - **1. Security Risk Assessments:** Focus on identifying, assessing, and implementing security controls within an application, system, or network.
    - **Threat Assessment:** Identifies different threats.
    - **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifies, quantifies, and prioritizes risks and vulnerabilities.
    - **Penetration Test (Pen Test):** Evaluates security by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
    - **Posture Assessment:** Assesses an organization's attack surface.
  - **2. Business Risk Assessments:** Focus on potential hazards concerning the day-to-day running of the company.
    - **Process Assessment:** Examines organizational processes against criteria.
    - **Vendor Assessment:** Evaluates prospective vendors to ensure they meet obligations and implement security controls (mitigates supply chain vulnerabilities).

âœ… **Mitigation**
- Risk management involves adding controls to mitigate risks (e.g., battery backups/generators for power loss vulnerability).
