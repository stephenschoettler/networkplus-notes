## ðŸ’¡ Device Hardening (OBJ 4.3)

Device Hardening is the process of making a host system or application configuration secure by reducing its attack surface. This involves running only necessary services, installing monitoring software, and establishing a maintenance schedule for patching. It is applied to endpoint devices, servers, network infrastructure, and mobile devices, with the goal of reducing the attack surface and risk of attack. Hardening requires balancing security with access requirements and system usability. The goal is to open the least amount of ports and run the least amount of services necessary to perform the job.

âœ… **Host Hardening Techniques**
- **1. Disable Unnecessary Network Interfaces:** Explicitly disable any unneeded wired or wireless network connections.
- **2. Disable Unnecessary Services:** Services run in the background. If a service is not being used, it should be disabled.
- **3. Close Unnecessary Ports:** Only keep ports open that are required for specific applications/services. Block all others using a host-based firewall.
- **4. Disk Encryption:** Enable full-disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker) or use self-encrypting drives to protect data at rest.
- **5. Account Management:** Disable/delete unneeded accounts, rename default accounts, change default passwords.
- **6. Standardized Baseline:** Configure a standardized, hardened baseline for the operating system.
- **7. Application Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** Use allow/deny lists for applications.
- **8. Restrict CLI/Peripheral Devices:** Limit command-line interface access and the use of external storage devices.

âœ… **Device Lifecycle (End of Life - EOL / End of Support - EOS)**
- **EOL Date:** Manufacturer no longer sells a product.
- **EOS Date:** Last date a manufacturer will provide support, patches, or updates.
- **Importance for Hardening:** After EOL/EOS, systems cannot be fully patched or updated, making them vulnerable to new exploits. Crucial to upgrade/replace systems before these dates.
