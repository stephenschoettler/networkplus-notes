## ðŸ’¡ Wiring a Network (OBJ 5.5)

This section covers the best practices for wiring a network. Always go from a switch to a patch panel. From the back of the patch panel, cables are punched down and run to wall jacks (keystone jacks). This modular approach simplifies troubleshooting, maintenance, and upgrades, and protects more expensive equipment.

âœ… **Patch Panels**
- Used to organize and terminate network cables.
- Have multiple jacks on the front and punch-down blocks (e.g., 110 block) on the back.
- Allow for a clean and organized installation in server racks.
- **Benefit:** Protect expensive switch ports. If a port on the patch panel breaks, it's cheaper to replace the patch panel than the entire switch.
- **Wiring Flow:** Wall jack -> punched down to patch panel -> patched into switch.

âœ… **Punch Down Blocks**
- Used to terminate network cables onto a patch panel or wall jack.
- Wires are inserted into slots and "punched down" with a punch-down tool, which cuts the excess wire and secures the connection.
- Follow specific color codes (e.g., T568A or T568B standards).

âœ… **Wall Jacks (Keystone Jacks)**
- Installed in walls to provide network access points.
- Have punch-down terminals on the back for connecting the in-wall cable.
- The keystone jack then snaps into a wall plate.

âœ… **Wiring Process**
- 1. Strip the outer jacket of the network cable.
- 2. Separate and straighten the individual wires.
- 3. Align wires according to the chosen wiring standard (T568A or T568B).
- 4. Use a punch-down tool to terminate the wires onto the punch-down block of the patch panel or keystone jack.

âœ… **T568A and T568B Standards**
- Two common wiring standards for RJ45 connectors and jacks.
- Determine the order of the colored wires.
- Crucial for ensuring proper connectivity.
