## ðŸ’¡ Wide Area Networks (WANs) (OBJ 1.5)

WANs are used to connect local area networks (LANs) and other networks over longer geographical distances, enabling communication between geographically dispersed locations. Historically, 80% of network traffic stayed within the LAN, and 20% went to the WAN. Today, this has largely flipped, with 80% of traffic often going out to the WAN (due to cloud services, streaming, VoIP, etc.) and only 20% remaining local.

âœ… **Common WAN Connection Types**
- This section will explore various technologies used for WAN connections:
  - **1. Fiber Optic Connections:**
    - High-speed, long-distance data transmission using light signals.
  - **2. Cable (DOCSIS) Connections:**
    - Utilizes existing cable television infrastructure for internet access.
  - **3. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):**
    - Provides internet access over traditional telephone lines. (Older technology, but still used in many areas).
  - **4. Satellite Connections:**
    - Internet access via satellite, including traditional geosynchronous (GEO) and newer low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink).
  - **5. Cellular Connections:**
    - Mobile broadband via cellular networks (e.g., smartphones, tablets, hotspots, fixed cellular internet).
  - **6. Microwave Connections:**
    - High-speed, point-to-point wireless connections often used in business parks, campuses, and metropolitan areas.
  - **7. Leased Lines:**
    - Dedicated, private, point-to-point connections between two locations, offering guaranteed bandwidth.
  - **8. MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) Connections:**
    - A high-performance forwarding technique used by ISPs to efficiently move data across their networks.
