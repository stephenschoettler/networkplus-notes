## ðŸ’¡ When to Automate and Orchestrate (OBJ 1.8)

Automation and Orchestration aim to streamline processes, enhance security, and improve operational efficiencies.

âœ… **Key Factors to Consider**
- **1. Complexity:**
  - **Automation:** Simple, routine tasks (e.g., backups).
  - **Orchestration:** Complex, multi-step processes (e.g., incident response runbooks).
- **2. Cost:**
  - High upfront investment vs. long-term savings.
  - Conduct cost-benefit analysis.
  - Start manual -> simple automation -> full orchestration.
- **3. Single Points of Failure:**
  - Ensure manual or backup systems exist if automation fails.
  - Implement redundancy/failover.
- **4. Technical Debt:**
  - Automated systems accumulate debt if not maintained/updated.
  - Mitigate with regular reviews and updates.
- **5. Ongoing Supportability:**
  - Ensure team has skills to maintain/adapt automations as technology evolves.
  - Changes in integrated systems (APIs) can break automations.

âœ… **Ideal Candidates for Automation**
- Repeatable and Stable Tasks/Workflows: Consistent over time.
- High-Volume, Repetitive Tasks: Performed frequently and at scale.

âœ… **Poor Candidates for Automation**
- One-off, highly variable, or frequently changing tasks.
