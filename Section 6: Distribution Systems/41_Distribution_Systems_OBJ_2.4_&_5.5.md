## ðŸ’¡ Distribution Systems (OBJ 2.4 & 5.5)

**Distribution Systems (Cable Distribution Systems/Cable Plants)** are the structured layout and organization of network media within a building for efficient and reliable data communication. They consist of cables, wall jacks, patch panels, Main Distribution Frames (MDFs), Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs), and other components.

âœ… **Section Focus (CompTIA Network+ N10-009)**
- **Domain 2: Network Implementation**
  - Objective 2.4: Explain important factors of physical installations.
- **Domain 5: Network Troubleshooting**
  - Objective 5.5: Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool or protocol to solve networking issues.

âœ… **Topics Covered in this Section**
- Cable distribution systems and their components.
- Proper network wiring (running cables, connecting to patch panels and wall jacks).
- Testing networks for breaks/faults using tools like a **toner probe** (fox and hound).
- Power distribution systems (PDUs, UPS, generators, power loads, voltage considerations).
- HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems (temperature, humidity, airflow management).
- Fire suppression systems (wet pipe, pre-action, clean agent systems).
