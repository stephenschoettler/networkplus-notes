## ðŸ’¡ Hardware Tools (OBJ. 5.5)
This section details various hardware tools used for network cabling, testing, and troubleshooting at the physical layer (Layer 1), including cabling tools, cable testers, and specialized fiber optic tools.

âœ… **Hardware Tools**
- Various physical tools used for network cabling, testing, and troubleshooting at Layer 1.

âœ… **Cabling Tools**
- **Snips/Cutters:** Cut cables.
- **Cable Strippers:** Remove cable insulation.
- **Cable Crimpers:** Attach connectors (RJ45, RJ11, coaxial).
- **Punch Down Tools:** Terminate wires on patch panels/jacks.

âœ… **Cable Testing & Diagnostics**
- **Cable Testers:** Verify continuity and pinouts (opens, shorts).
- **Wire Mapping Tools:** Diagnose specific twisted pair issues (open, short, reverse, cross, split pairs).
- **Cable Certifiers:** Determine cable category/throughput, length, delay, resistance. More detailed than testers.
- **Multimeters:** Check voltage, amperage, resistance of copper cables; test power sources.
- **Tone Generators (Toner Probe/Fox and Hound):** Trace unlabeled cables by generating/detecting a tone.
- **Loopback Adapters:** Test network interface functionality by looping transmit to receive signals.
- **Time-Domain Reflectometer (TDR):** Locates breaks in copper cables.
- **Optical Time-Domain Reflectometer (OTDR):** Locates breaks in fiber optic cables.
- **Fiber Light Meters (Optical Power Meters):** Measure light loss (attenuation) in fiber cables.

âœ… **Fiber Specific Tools**
- **Fusion Splicers:** Permanently join two fiber optic cables (for repairs on long runs).

âœ… **Monitoring & Analysis Tools**
- **TAPs (Test Access Points):** In-line devices that copy network traffic for analysis/security.
- **Spectrum Analyzers:** Measure signal amplitude across frequencies (copper, RF).
