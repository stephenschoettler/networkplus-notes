## ðŸ’¡ Step Six (OBJ. 5.1)
This section details the sixth step of the troubleshooting methodology: verifying full system functionality and implementing preventive measures to ensure the problem is resolved and to prevent future recurrence.

âœ… **Step 6: Verify full system functionality and implement preventive measures if applicable**
- Goal: Ensure the problem is solved and prevent future recurrence.

âœ… **Verify Full System Functionality**
- Confirm original problem is resolved.
- Inspect other components for accidental damage/disconnections.
- Verify disabled/uninstalled software/services remain off.
- Check logs/diagnostic tools for proper operation.
- Update software/drivers for stability/security.
- System should work as good as, or better than, before.

âœ… **Implement Preventive Measures**
- Purpose: Prevent recurrence of the issue.
- Identify root cause (e.g., insecure user behavior, physical damage).
- Educate users on safe practices.
- Implement policy/process changes (e.g., lidded coffee cups, software download policies).
- Escalate to management if lacking authority for broader changes.
- Benefit: Reduces recurring issues and future trouble tickets.
