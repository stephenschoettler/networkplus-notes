## ðŸ’¡ Threats and Vulnerabilities (OBJ 4.1)

Risk exists where threats and vulnerabilities intersect.

âœ… **Threat**
- A person or an event that has the potential for impacting a valuable resource in a negative manner.
- **Internal Threats:** Originate from within the organization (malicious or accidental).
- **External Threats:** Originate from outside the organization (e.g., hackers, environmental conditions).

âœ… **Vulnerability**
- A weakness in system design, implementation, source code, or lack of preventive mechanisms that might allow a threat to be realized.
- **Environmental Vulnerabilities:** Undesirable conditions in the general areas surrounding a building (e.g., hurricanes, earthquakes).
- **Physical Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in the physical building (e.g., unlocked doors, unmonitored hallways).
- **Operational Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in how the network/systems are run (e.g., poorly worded policies).
- **Technical Vulnerabilities:** System-specific conditions creating a weakness (e.g., misconfigurations, outdated hardware, malicious software).

âœ… **Types of Technical Vulnerabilities**
- **1. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):**
  - **Definition:** A publicly disclosed list of known computer security weaknesses or flaws.
  - **Nature:** Known vulnerabilities.
  - **Exploits:** Most CVEs have matching exploits (software code that takes advantage of the flaw).
- **2. Zero-Day Vulnerability:**
  - **Definition:** A weakness in a system that is unknown at the time of its discovery by an attacker.
  - **Nature:** Brand-new, undisclosed vulnerabilities.
  - **Transition:** Once reported, it becomes a CVE.

âœ… **Exploit**
- **Definition:** A piece of software code that takes advantage of a security flaw or vulnerability.
- **Mechanism:** Used to attack vulnerable systems (e.g., unpatched machines). Often incorporated into malware.

âœ… **Mitigation**
- Patch systems regularly to address CVEs.
- Use up-to-date anti-malware/antivirus software.
- Implement preventive measures to reduce vulnerabilities.
