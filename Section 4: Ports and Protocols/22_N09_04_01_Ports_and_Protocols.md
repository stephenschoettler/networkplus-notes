## ðŸ’¡ Ports and Protocols

A **port** is a virtual point of entry or exit for communications used by software applications to exchange information. A **protocol** is a set of rules and conventions for data exchange between network devices, ensuring structured and predictable data transmission. Ports and protocols are essential building blocks for efficient and secure data sharing.

âœ… **Port Ranges**
- **Well-known Ports:** 0 to 1023 (e.g., HTTP 80, HTTPS 443).
- **Registered Ports:** 1024 to 49,151.
- **Dynamic or Private Ports:** 49,152 to 65,535.

âœ… **Key Protocols and Services**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable, connection-oriented.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Unreliable, connectionless.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):** Used for network diagnostics (e.g., Ping).
- **Web Ports and Protocols:**
  - **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** 80 (unencrypted web traffic).
  - **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** 443 (secure, encrypted web traffic).
- **Email Ports and Protocols:**
  - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** 25 (sending emails).
  - **SMTPS (Secure SMTP):** 587 (secure sending emails).
  - **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3):** 110 (receiving emails, downloads to client).
  - **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** 143 (receiving emails, keeps on server).
- **File Transfer Ports and Protocols:**
  - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** 20 (data), 21 (control) (unencrypted file transfer).
  - **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol):** 22 (secure file transfer over SSH).
  - **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol):** 69 (simple, unauthenticated file transfer).
- **Remote Access Ports and Protocols:**
  - **SSH (Secure Shell):** 22 (secure remote access).
  - **Telnet:** 23 (insecure remote access).
  - **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):** 3389 (remote desktop access).
- **Networking Service Ports and Protocols:**
  - **DNS (Domain Name System):** 53 (translates domain names to IP addresses).
  - **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** 67 (server), 68 (client) (assigns IP addresses automatically).
  - **SQL (Structured Query Language):** 1433 (database communication).
  - **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** 161 (agent), 162 (manager) (network device management).
  - **Syslog:** 514 (logging system messages).
- **Other Network Service Ports and Protocols:**
  - **NTP (Network Time Protocol):** 123 (time synchronization).
  - **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):** 5060 (UDP/TCP), 5061 (TCP/TLS) (voice/video communication).
  - **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):** 389 (directory services, insecure).
  - **LDAPS (LDAP Secure):** 636 (secure directory services).
