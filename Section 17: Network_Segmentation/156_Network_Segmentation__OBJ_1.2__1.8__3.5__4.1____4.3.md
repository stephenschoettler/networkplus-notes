## ðŸ’¡ Network Segmentation (OBJ 1.2, 1.8, 3.5, 4.1, 4.3)

Network Segmentation's purpose is to secure networks by implementing different network security features and segmentation technologies. The role of a network technician includes configuring devices and implementing security upgrades.

âœ… **CompTIA Objectives Covered**
- **1.2:** Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
- **1.8:** Summarize evolving use cases for modern network environments.
- **3.5:** Compare and contrast network access and management methods.
- **4.1:** Explain the importance of basic network security concepts.
- **4.3:** Apply network security features, defense techniques, and solutions.

âœ… **Key Concepts/Topics Covered in this Section**
- Firewalls: Boundary devices for analyzing and filtering traffic.
- Access Control Lists (ACLs): Rules used with firewalls/routers to permit/deny traffic.
- Segmentation Zones: Creating trusted, untrusted, and semi-trusted (screened subnet/DMZ) zones.
- Jumpboxes: Trusted devices for connecting into semi-trusted zones.
- Content Filtering & Proxy Servers: Restricting access to content and managing internet traffic.
- Internet of Things (IoT): Devices connecting to the internet beyond traditional computers (smart devices, wearables, sensors).
- SCADA & ICS: Operational Technology (OT) for controlling real-world actions.
- Bring Your Own Device (BYOD): Policies for using personal devices in the workplace and alternatives.
- Zero-Trust Architecture: Security model focusing on continuous verification, trusting no one by default.
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Securely connecting remote users/sites via encrypted tunnels.
- Remote Access Management: Options for connecting to and configuring network devices remotely.
