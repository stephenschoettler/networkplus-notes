## ðŸ’¡ Fiber Media (OBJ 1.5)

Fiber media transmits data using light (LEDs or lasers) over glass or plastic cables. Remember the core differences: Single-mode for long distances and higher cost, Multi-mode for shorter distances and lower cost. Identify them by their sheath colors (Yellow for SMF, Aqua/Orange for MMF).

âœ… **Advantages of Fiber Media over Copper**
- **Immunity to EMI (Electromagnetic Interference):** Light signals are not affected by electrical interference.
- **Longer Distances:** Can transmit data over hundreds of meters to hundreds of miles without significant signal loss (copper is limited to ~100m for twisted pair, ~300m for coaxial).
- **Higher Data Transfer Speeds:** Can achieve much faster speeds than copper (e.g., 10 Gbps to 100 Gbps and beyond, compared to copper's typical max of 10 Gbps).

âœ… **Drawbacks of Fiber Media**
- **Cost:** More expensive than copper media (cables and supporting network equipment).
- **Complexity:** More difficult to work with, requiring special tools and training for installation and repair.

âœ… **Types of Fiber Optic Cables**
- **1. Single-Mode Fiber (SMF):**
  - **Purpose:** Designed for **long-distance communication**.
  - **Core Size:** Very small glass core (8.3 to 10 microns in diameter).
  - **Light Travel:** Light travels down a single path, minimizing dispersion.
  - **Distance:** Up to tens or hundreds of miles.
  - **Usage:** Preferred for backbone installations in large networks, connections between geographically dispersed network segments, and high bandwidth over long distances.
  - **Identification:** Typically has a **yellow** plastic sheath.
- **2. Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF):**
  - **Purpose:** Tailored for **shorter distances**.
  - **Core Size:** Larger fiber core (50 to 100 microns).
  - **Light Travel:** Light travels in multiple paths, leading to more dispersion.
  - **Distance:** Limited distance (typically under 2000 meters/2 km/1 mile), but still much longer than copper.
  - **Usage:** Commonly used within buildings, across smaller campuses, for connecting servers and switches within a single data center, or as a replacement for copper patch cables where higher data rates or EMI immunity are needed over shorter runs.
  - **Identification:** Typically has an **aqua blue** or **orange** plastic sheath.
  - **Cost:** Tends to be less expensive to buy and install than single-mode fiber.
