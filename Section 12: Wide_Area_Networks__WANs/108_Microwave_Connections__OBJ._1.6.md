## ðŸ’¡ Microwave Connections (OBJ 1.6)

Microwave connections are a communication system that uses a beam of **radio waves in the microwave frequency band** (300 MHz to 300 GHz) to transmit information between two fixed locations. They are popular for high-speed, point-to-point connections between buildings in business parks, college campuses, or metropolitan areas where running fiber is difficult or costly.

âœ… **Key Characteristics**
- **Line of Sight (LOS):** Requires a clear, unobstructed visual path between the two antennas. Obstacles (buildings, terrain) block the signal.
- **Distance Limitation:** Due to the Earth's curvature and visual horizon, the practical distance limit is typically around **40 miles (64 km)**.
- **Speed:** Can provide very fast connections, often up to 1 Gigabit per second or more, depending on the technology and frequency used.
- **Installation:** Requires professional installation of antennas on rooftops or high points.

âœ… **WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)**
- A marketing term for microwave access, based on the **IEEE 802.16 standard**.
- Historically popular for providing high-speed internet in areas where DSL or cable were unavailable.

âœ… **Comparison to Other WAN Technologies**
- **Speed:** Generally faster than DSL and older cellular generations. Can be comparable to 4G/5G mid-band.
- **Cost:** More expensive than cable modems for direct-to-consumer internet.
- **Installation:** More complex than cellular (requires fixed antenna installation) but less disruptive than laying new fiber.
- **Current Relevance:** While less common for direct-to-consumer internet due to the rise of 4G/5G cellular and fiber, microwave links are still widely used for **internal WAN connections** (e.g., connecting buildings on a campus) and in niche areas.
