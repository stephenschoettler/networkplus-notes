## ðŸ’¡ QoS Categorization (OBJ 1.2)

QoS Categorization aims to categorize different types of network traffic into "buckets" and apply specific policies and priorities to each, ensuring optimal network performance for critical applications. It's needed because in converged networks (voice, data, video on same infrastructure), different traffic types have different sensitivity to delay, jitter, and loss.
**Trade-off:** IntServ (Hard QoS) offers the highest level of service guarantees but is less flexible and can be inefficient. DiffServ (Soft QoS) offers more flexibility and efficient resource utilization, making it generally preferred for dynamic network environments.

âœ… **QoS Models/Approaches**
- **1. Best Effort:**
  - **Concept:** No QoS applied; traffic is handled on a "first-in, first-out" basis.
  - **Characteristics:** No guarantees, no reordering or shaping. "Every man for himself."
  - **Use Case:** Simple networks where all traffic is treated equally.
- **2. Integrated Services (IntServ) / Hard QoS:**
  - **Concept:** Makes **strict bandwidth reservations** for specific traffic types.
  - **Characteristics:** Provides strong guarantees for performance (e.g., dedicated bandwidth for VoIP).
  - **Limitation:** Less flexible; if reserved bandwidth is not used, it remains idle and cannot be utilized by other traffic. Can lead to inefficient resource use.
- **3. Differentiated Services (DiffServ) / Soft QoS:**
  - **Concept:** Traffic is **classified and marked** (e.g., with DSCP values in IP headers).
  - Routers and switches then make forwarding decisions based on these markings.
  - **Characteristics:**
    - **Flexible:** Bandwidth allocations are more of a "suggestion" and can fluctuate based on real-time demand.
    - **Efficient:** Unused bandwidth from one category can be temporarily used by another.
    - **Most preferred in modern networks** due to its flexibility and efficient resource utilization.

âœ… **General QoS Implementation Mechanisms**
- **Classification and Marking:** Identifying and tagging traffic types.
- **Congestion Management:** Managing queues when network links are saturated.
- **Congestion Avoidance:** Proactively dropping less critical traffic before severe congestion occurs.
- **Policing and Shaping:** Controlling traffic rates to ensure they adhere to defined policies.
- **Link Efficiency:** Optimizing the use of available bandwidth.
