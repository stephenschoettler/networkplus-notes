## ðŸ’¡ Leased Line Connections (OBJ 1.5)

A **leased line** is a continuous, dedicated connection between two points, set up by a telecommunications provider (using copper or fiber). Unlike shared broadband services, a leased line provides **fixed bandwidth** and a **symmetric data connection** exclusively reserved for the subscriber's use. Leased lines represent a premium connectivity solution, offering unmatched speed, reliability, and security. They are a strategic investment for organizations where consistent and secure communication is a critical operational requirement, rather than a typical home or small office solution.

âœ… **Advantages of Leased Lines**
- **1. Performance:**
  - **Dedicated Bandwidth:** Guarantees consistent speed, as capacity is not shared with other users.
  - **Symmetric Speeds:** Upload and download speeds are identical, crucial for businesses that heavily upload data (e.g., video content, large files).
- **2. Scalability:**
  - Offers a wide range of bandwidth options, from a few Mbps to 10 Gbps or more, allowing businesses to scale connectivity as needed.
- **3. Reliability:**
  - Providers often offer stringent **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** with high uptime guarantees (e.g., 99.9% or higher).
  - Minimizes downtime and ensures continuous network availability.
- **4. Security:**
  - Data travels over a direct connection, reducing exposure to public internet pathways and potential cyber threats.
  - Ideal for organizations handling sensitive information (e.g., financial institutions, healthcare).

âœ… **Disadvantage: Cost**
- Leased lines are significantly **more expensive** than shared services like DSL or cable.
- Cost depends on bandwidth, distance, and contract length.

âœ… **Typical Use Cases**
- **Businesses and Organizations:** That require dedicated, reliable, and high-performance internet connections.
- **Connecting Branch Offices:** Used to create a Wide Area Network (WAN) between geographically dispersed offices, ensuring seamless communication and data sharing.
