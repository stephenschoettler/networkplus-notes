## ðŸ’¡ Media and Cabling Distributions (OBJ 1.5 & 5.5)

Media in networking refers to the physical material used to transmit data between devices. The most common types are **copper**, **fiber**, and **radio frequency waves**. This section will provide a foundational understanding of the physical layer of networking, crucial for both network design and troubleshooting.

âœ… **Section Focus (CompTIA Network+ N10-009)**
- **Domain 1: Networking Concepts**
  - Objective 1.5: Compare and contrast transmission media and transceivers.
- **Domain 5: Network Troubleshooting**
  - Objective 5.5: Given a scenario, use the appropriate tool or protocol to solve networking issues.

âœ… **Topics Covered in this Section**
- **Copper Media:** Different types, bandwidth, and distance limitations.
- **Copper Network Connections:** Connectors used (RJ45, RJ11, F-Type, BNC).
- **Building Copper Cables:** How to create patch cables using tools like cable strippers, crimpers, and testers.
- **Fiber Media:** Single-mode and multi-mode fiber, their benefits and limitations.
- **Fiber Network Connections:** Connectors used (SC, ST, LC, MTRJ, MTP).
- **Transceivers:** Devices that combine transmission and receiving capabilities, often used to connect different media types (e.g., fiber and copper).
