This section defines configuration management in networking, highlighting its importance for maintaining up-to-date documentation of network configurations, including asset management, baselining, cable management, and comprehensive network documentation.

âœ… **Configuration Management**
- Definition: Maintaining up-to-date documentation of network configurations.
- Importance: Crucial for incident response, understanding the network, and overall network health.

âœ… **Key Components**
- **1. Asset Management:**
  - Tracking network components and their lifecycle (from planning to improvement).
  - Ensures proper budgeting and device management.
- **2. Baselining:**
  - Collecting data under normal conditions to define "normal" network behavior.
  - Allows identification of anomalies during troubleshooting.
- **3. Cable Management:**
  - Documenting cable infrastructure: diagrams, labeling (standard naming conventions), punch-down block locations, cable sources/destinations.
  - Essential for large, complex networks.
- **4. Network Documentation:**
  - Keeping all network-related documents updated.
  - Includes: Network diagrams, wiring schematics, admin contacts, policies, vendor info, SOPs.
  - Ensures quick access to critical info, supports troubleshooting, and aids junior staff.
