## ðŸ’¡ Understanding the Troubleshooting Methodology (OBJ. 5.1)
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the 7-step troubleshooting methodology, a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve network problems effectively.

âœ… **7-Step Troubleshooting Methodology**
- A systematic approach to diagnose and resolve network problems.
- **1. Identify the problem:**
  - Gather info: Question user, identify symptoms.
  - Ask: "Anything changed?", "Can duplicate?".
  - Treat multiple users with similar issues individually.
- **2. Establish a theory of probable cause:**
  - Brainstorm potential causes.
  - Question the obvious.
  - Consider approaches: Top-to-bottom, bottom-up, divide and conquer.
  - *No action yet, just theory formation.*
- **3. Test the theory to determine the cause:**
  - Test your theory.
  - If confirmed: Proceed.
  - If ruled out: Go back to Step 2 (new theory).
- **4. Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects:**
  - Plan the solution once cause is known.
  - Consider potential side effects.
- **5. Implement the solution or escalate as necessary:**
  - Execute the plan.
  - Implement if authorized; otherwise, escalate.
- **6. Verify full system functionality and if applicable, implement preventive measures:**
  - Confirm problem is fixed.
  - Verify all systems work.
  - Implement measures to prevent recurrence (e.g., address unauthorized changes).
- **7. Document findings, actions, outcomes, and lessons learned:**
  - Record in trouble ticket system.
  - Include: symptoms, theories, diagnostic steps, solution, outcome, changes, lessons learned.
  - Builds knowledge base and aids future troubleshooting.
