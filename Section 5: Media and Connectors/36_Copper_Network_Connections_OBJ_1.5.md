## ðŸ’¡ Copper Network Connections (OBJ 1.5)

This lesson covers various copper network connection types, focusing on the connectors used with twisted pair and coaxial cables. Understand the primary use case for each connector type (RJ-11 for voice, RJ-45 for data, F-type for cable TV/internet, BNC for professional video). Remember that RG-6 is the modern standard for CATV/internet over RG-59.

âœ… **Registered Jack (RJ) Connectors (for Twisted Pair Cables)**
- **RJ-11:**
  - **Usage:** Standard for **telephone wiring**.
  - **Configuration:** 6-position, 2-conductor (6P2C).
  - **Characteristics:** Smaller size, not suitable for high-speed data transmission.
- **RJ-45:**
  - **Usage:** Standard for **data networks** (Ethernet) using copper cables.
  - **Configuration:** 8-position, 8-conductor (8P8C).
  - **Characteristics:** Widely used to connect computers, switches, and routers. Supports high-speed data transfer and is used with Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7, and Cat8 cables.

âœ… **Radio Guide (RG) Connectors (for Coaxial Cables)**
- **F-type Connector:**
  - **Usage:** Common for **cable television (CATV)**, satellite, and cable internet connections. Used with RG-6 and RG-59 coaxial cables.
  - **Mechanism:** Screw-on connector.
  - **RG-6:** Modern standard for CATV and internet. Thicker gauge, better shielding, supports higher bandwidth/frequency over longer distances.
  - **RG-59:** Older standard, lower bandwidth/frequency. Still found in some Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) systems. Not suitable for high-bandwidth applications.
- **BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) Connector:**
  - **Usage:** Used with RG-6 or RG-59 coaxial cables for **professional video connections** (studios, surveillance systems) and some radio frequency applications.
  - **Mechanism:** Push-and-twist (bayonet locking) mechanism for a secure connection.
  - **Characteristics:** Provides a quick and secure connection, praised for reliability.
