## ðŸ’¡ Fiber Optic Connections (OBJ 1.5)

Fiber optic connections are crucial for modern high-speed internet, serving as the backbone for hyperconnected lifestyles. Different types are categorized by how close the fiber optic cable gets to the end-user's premises. Understanding these FTTx distinctions is crucial when evaluating internet services. FTTH generally offers the best performance, while FTTC, FTTN, and FTTB represent varying compromises between cost, ease of deployment, and speed, with performance decreasing as the copper segment lengthens.

âœ… **Types of Fiber Optic Deployments (FTTx)**
- **1. FTTH (Fiber to the Home):**
  - **Concept:** Fiber optic cable runs directly into the individual residence or home office.
  - **Characteristics:** Offers the **highest speed and reliability** because the entire connection from the service provider to the user's terminal is fiber.
  - **Ideal for:** Users demanding the best internet connectivity (e.g., professional home offices, gamers, streamers).
- **2. FTTC (Fiber to the Curb / Cabinet):**
  - **Concept:** Fiber optic cables run to a curbside or a nearby street cabinet. From there, traditional **copper cables** complete the journey into the home or office.
  - **Characteristics:** Offers significant speed improvements over entirely copper networks, striking a balance between cost and performance. Still very fast, but not as fast as FTTH due to the copper segment.
- **3. FTTN (Fiber to the Node / Neighborhood):**
  - **Concept:** Fiber optic connection extends to a central point (node) in a particular area or neighborhood. From that node, **copper cables** branch out to individual locations (apartments, condos, housing units).
  - **Characteristics:** The distance between the node and the premises is typically greater than FTTC, which can affect speed and reliability. Leverages existing copper infrastructure to offer improved speeds without full fiber to every home. Generally slower than FTTH and FTTC.
- **4. FTTB (Fiber to the Building / Basement):**
  - **Concept:** Fiber optic cables reach the building's main communication room or basement.
  - From there, **copper cabling** (e.g., Cat 6A) is used to connect to individual units or offices within the building.
  - **Characteristics:** Common in multi-dwelling units (apartments, condos, office complexes). Provides high-speed fiber close to users without running fiber to each individual unit. Can support high internal speeds (e.g., 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps) within the building.
