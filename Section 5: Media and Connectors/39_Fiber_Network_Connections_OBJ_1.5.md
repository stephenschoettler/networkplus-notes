## ðŸ’¡ Fiber Network Connections (OBJ 1.5)

A **fiber network connection** involves connecting a fiber optic cable to two devices, using fiber connectors on each end for quick connection/disconnection. Most fiber optic cables require two connectors: one for transmit and one for receive. Understand the different connector types and their common use cases. Also, know the purpose of different polish styles, especially that APC provides the lowest back reflection.

âœ… **Types of Fiber Connectors**
- **1. SC (Subscriber Connector):**
  - **Shape/Mechanism:** Square shape, push-pull design.
  - **Mnemonic:** "Stick and Click" connector.
  - **Usage:** Widely used in single-mode fibers due to precision and minimal signal loss. Common in telecommunications, data networking, and Fiber to the Home (FTTH) deployments.
  - **Characteristics:** Durable, easy to use, secure connection.
- **2. LC (Lucent Connector):**
  - **Shape/Mechanism:** Compact size, push-pull mechanism (similar to SC but smaller).
  - **Mnemonic:** "Love Connector" (often shipped as a coupled pair).
  - **Usage:** Highly favored in high-density applications (data centers, telecom rooms) due to smaller size allowing greater port density.
  - **Characteristics:** High precision alignment, minimizes data loss.
- **3. ST (Straight Tip Connector):**
  - **Shape/Mechanism:** Round shape, twist-lock mechanism.
  - **Mnemonic:** "Stick and Twist" connector.
  - **Usage:** Commonly used with multi-mode fiber optic cables. Found in campus network environments (fiber runs between buildings).
  - **Characteristics:** Robust, reliable, durable, well-suited for outdoor applications where movement/vibrations might occur.
- **4. MTRJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack):**
  - **Shape/Mechanism:** Small, rectangular design, houses both transmit and receive fibers in a single connector.
  - **Usage:** Used in space-constrained applications, often for connecting devices within a Local Area Network (LAN) in office buildings (e.g., workstations, servers).
  - **Characteristics:** High density, accommodates two fibers in one connector, reduces space needed.
- **5. MPO (Multi-fiber Push On Connector):**
  - **Purpose:** Designed to accommodate multiple fibers (12 or more) in a single connector.
  - **Usage:** Essential for high-density applications, widely used in data centers and high-speed networks for backbone cabling and interconnections.
  - **Characteristics:** Significantly increases capacity and flexibility, allows quick and efficient connection of multiple fibers, reduces installation time.

âœ… **Fiber Polish Styles**
- **Back Reflection:** Light reflecting back into the transmitter, which can degrade the signal. Minimizing it is crucial.
- **1. PC (Physical Contact):**
  - **Design:** Slight curvature in the fiber face.
  - **Performance:** Lower back reflection than standard straight-cut fiber, but least effective reduction among the three.
  - **Usage:** Commonly used in digital and telephone services. Best suited for applications where back reflection is less of a concern (short distance, lower speed).
- **2. UPC (Ultra Physical Contact):**
  - **Design:** Dome-shaped end face for better core alignment.
  - **Performance:** Lower back reflection than PC style. Updated and better version of PC.
  - **Usage:** Found in general broadband, data, and video applications. Offers a good balance between performance and cost.
- **3. APC (Angled Physical Contact):**
  - **Design:** 8-degree angled polish.
  - **Performance:** Lowest amount of back reflection, significantly reduces signal degradation.
  - **Usage:** Well-suited for high-bandwidth and long-distance applications (e.g., long-haul fiber installations, undersea cables).
  - **Characteristics:** Costs more than PC or UPC.
