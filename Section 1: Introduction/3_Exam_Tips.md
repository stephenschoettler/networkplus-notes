## ðŸ’¡ Exam Tips

This section provides tips for taking the CompTIA Network+ exam.

âœ… **Read Questions Carefully**
- No trick questions; read multiple times to understand exactly what is being asked.

âœ… **Identify Distractors**
- Eliminate incorrect answer choices to increase chances of guessing correctly.

âœ… **Pay Attention to Formatting**
- Bold, italics, or all-uppercase words are important keywords.

âœ… **"Book Answer" Rule**
- Answer questions based on CompTIA Network+ knowledge from the course/official textbook, not personal workplace experience.
- Select the answer that is true most often or in the most cases.

âœ… **Understand Key Concepts**
- Focus on the core concept the test writer is asking about, rather than fighting the question.

âœ… **Keyword Association Examples**
- Confidentiality â†’ Encryption
- Integrity â†’ Hashing
- Availability â†’ Redundancy and Resiliency

âœ… **Recognition, Not Recitation**
- You don't need to memorize terms word-for-word; just recognize them from answer choices.
- No fill-in-the-blank or essay questions.

âœ… **Vendor-Neutral Knowledge**
- Exam questions are generic; you only need to know *what* a tool is used for, not specific syntax or how to operate it.
- Example: For NMAP, know it's a network mapping tool used to find open ports, not the specific command.

âœ… **Set a Target Date**
- Plan your study schedule (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days) and work backward to stay on track.
- Aim for 1-2 hours of study per day for 30-day certification.
- Avoid studying over a very long period (6-12 months) to prevent forgetting earlier material.
