## ðŸ’¡ Cloud and the Datacenter (OBJ 1.3 & 1.8)

This section explores cloud computing, network virtualization, and datacenter concepts, which are integral to modern network environments.

âœ… **CompTIA Network+ Objectives Covered**
- **OBJ 1.3:** Summarize cloud concepts and connectivity options.
- **OBJ 1.8:** Summarize evolving use cases for modern network environments.

âœ… **Key Topics Covered in this Section**
- **1. Cloud Computing Overview:**
  - What cloud computing is and its general uses.
- **2. Cloud Service Models:**
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure.
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
- **3. Cloud Deployment Models:**
  - **Public Cloud:** Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone.
  - **Private Cloud:** Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization.
  - **Community Cloud:** Shared by several organizations with common concerns.
  - **Hybrid Cloud:** A mix of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, public, community) that remain unique entities but are bound together.
- **4. Cloud Connectivity:**
  - How to access, configure, and manage cloud-based services.
- **5. Cloud Security:**
  - Using **Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)** to protect data within a cloud provider's environment.
- **6. Network Virtualization:**
  - How traditional network devices (switches, routers, firewalls) are virtualized and deployed as software applications in the cloud.
- **7. SDN (Software Defined Networks):**
  - Separating network control (control plane) from data forwarding (data plane) to create more scalable and efficient networks.
- **8. SD-WAN (Software Defined Wide Area Networks):**
  - Applying SDN principles to WAN connections, often used in cloud-based environments for optimized traffic management.
- **9. VXLAN (Virtual Extensible Local Area Network):**
  - An encapsulation protocol used to create virtual overlay networks over existing Layer 3 infrastructure, heavily used in highly scalable cloud networks.
- **10. SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and SSE (Security Service Edge):**
  - Cloud-native security architectures that combine network and security functions, becoming increasingly important in cloud-based networks.
