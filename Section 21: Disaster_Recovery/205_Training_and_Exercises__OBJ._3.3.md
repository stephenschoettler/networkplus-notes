## ðŸ’¡ Training and Exercises (OBJ. 3.3)
This section explores various training and exercise types, including tabletop exercises and penetration testing, along with the roles of Red, Blue, and White Teams, to enhance disaster recovery and cybersecurity preparedness.

âœ… **Training and Exercises**
- Various exercises to test and improve disaster recovery and cybersecurity posture.

âœ… **Tabletop Exercises**
- **Purpose:** Discuss simulated emergency/security scenarios.
- **Pros:** Simple to set up.
- **Cons:** Theoretical; don't provide practical timing/evidence; can create unrealistic expectations.

âœ… **Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)**
- **Purpose:** Actively evaluate security by simulating attacks to find/exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Activities:** Discover vulnerabilities, test security controls, identify logical weaknesses, assess social engineering susceptibility.
- **Key Considerations:**
  - **Scoping:** Must be clearly defined (what to test, what's in scope).
  - **Teams:** Best done by unbiased third-party or dedicated internal Red Teams (not system admins).

âœ… **Red, Blue, and White Teams**
- **Red Team:** The attacking/hostile team (offensive security).
- **Blue Team:** The defensive team (system admins, network defenders, cybersecurity analysts).
- **White Team:** Administers, evaluates, and supervises the exercise; acts as referee; builds test environments; reports on performance.
