## ðŸ’¡ Network Virtualization (OBJ 1.3)

Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a transformative concept that reshapes telecommunications by introducing agility and flexibility to networks. It abstracts network functions from dedicated hardware appliances and deploys them as software applications (Virtual Network Functions - VNFs) on standard commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers.

âœ… **NFV Core Components**
- **1. NFV Infrastructure (NFVI):**
  - Includes all the hardware and virtual resources necessary for deploying, managing, and executing VNFs.
  - Provides computational, storage, and network resources with a virtualization layer.
- **2. Management and Network Orchestration (MANO):**
  - The "brains" of NFV.
  - Oversees the lifecycle management of VNFs and orchestrates resources across the NFVI.
  - Ensures efficient deployment and scaling of functions based on demand.
- **3. Virtual Network Functions (VNFs):**
  - Software implementations of network functions traditionally tied to hardware (e.g., virtual routers, firewalls, load balancers).
  - Instantiated on the NFVI and can be chained together to create full-scale network services.

âœ… **Advantages of NFV**
- **Increased Flexibility & Rapid Deployment:** Network services can be scaled up or down on the fly without physical hardware installations.
- **Cost Efficiencies:** Moves away from proprietary hardware to less expensive COTS servers, reducing capital expenditures.
- **Lower Operational Costs:** Decoupling software and hardware means upgrades/scaling don't always require hardware replacements.

âœ… **Challenges of NFV**
- **Security Concerns:** Virtualized environments can introduce new security challenges.
- **Complexity of Management:** Managing and orchestrating virtualized functions can be complex.
- **Need for Skilled Personnel:** Requires personnel proficient in virtualization technologies.
