## ðŸ’¡ Software Tools (OBJ. 5.5)
This section explores various software tools used for network troubleshooting, configuration, and management, including Wi-Fi analyzers, protocol analyzers, bandwidth testers, port scanners, NetFlow analyzers, and IP scanners.

âœ… **Software Tools**
- Various software tools are used for network troubleshooting, configuration, and management.

âœ… **Wi-Fi Analyzers**
- Purpose: Conduct wireless surveys, ensure proper coverage, prevent AP overlap.
- Function: Display SSIDs, signal strength (RSSI), channels; generate heat maps.
- Use: Identify channel interference, optimize AP placement.

âœ… **Protocol Analyzers & Packet Captures**
- **Protocol Analyzer:** Captures and analyzes data traffic.
- **Packet Capture:** Captures real-time packets for later analysis.
- Purpose: Intercept, log, analyze traffic for troubleshooting, classification, security.
- Tools: Wireshark (combines both), tcpdump.
- Use: Troubleshoot performance, validate operations, trace connections, identify suspicious traffic.

âœ… **Bandwidth Speed Tests (Throughput Tests)**
- Purpose: Measure real-world data transfer speed (throughput).
- Types: Internet speed tests (client to internet), LAN speed tests (client to client on local network).
- Use: Determine if internet or LAN performance is adequate.

âœ… **Port Scanners**
- Purpose: Determine which ports are open and listening on a network device/server.
- Function: Sends packets, analyzes responses (open, closed, filtered).
- Tools: Nmap.
- Use: Network reconnaissance, identify services, detect firewalls.

âœ… **NetFlow Analyzers**
- Purpose: Monitor, troubleshoot, and inspect traffic flow data.
- Function: Analyzes NetFlow data (metadata about conversations).
- Use: Capacity planning, resource utilization, identify traffic types (e.g., social media, VoIP), optimize performance.

âœ… **IP Scanners**
- Purpose: Search for and detect IP addresses and device info on a network.
- Function: Identifies active hosts, often combined with port scanning.
- Tools: Nmap.
- Use: Network management, identify rogue devices.
