## ðŸ’¡ Logical Security (OBJ 1.4, 4.1, 4.3)

Logical Security refers to non-physical measures implemented to protect digital data, restrict unauthorized access, and ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

âœ… **CompTIA Objectives Covered**
- **1.4:** Explain common networking ports, protocols, services, and traffic types.
- **4.1:** Explain the importance of basic network security concepts.
- **4.3:** Apply network security features, defense techniques, and solutions.

âœ… **Key Concepts/Topics Covered in this Section**
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Framework for ensuring the right individuals have appropriate access to resources.
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA): Requires two or more authentication methods for login.
- Authentication Methods: Various ways to verify identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics, tokens).
- Security Principles: Foundational concepts like least privilege and access control methods (DAC, MAC, RBAC).
- Encryption: Protecting data confidentiality in different states (at rest, in motion, in processing).
- IPSec (Internet Protocol Security): Secure network protocol suite for authentication and encryption of IP packets.
- PKI (Public Key Infrastructure): System for managing digital keys and certificates.
- Digital Certificates: Electronically signed documents binding public keys to identities.
- Key Management: Securely creating, managing, and destroying encryption keys.
