## ðŸ’¡ Network Monitoring (OBJ 1.2 & 3.2)

Network Monitoring is the continuous observation and analysis of the performance of a computer network in real-time using various tools and technologies. Its purpose is to ensure operational integrity and optimal performance, detect and report issues (traffic bottlenecks, network outages, unauthorized access, inefficiencies, security breaches), preemptively identify potential problems, maintain reliability, stability, and security, and minimize downtime and improve user experience. Methods include a combination of software and hardware solutions to track metrics like bandwidth utilization, uptime, and device availability.

âœ… **CompTIA Objectives**
- **1.2:** Compare and contrast networking appliances, applications, and functions.
- **3.2:** Use network monitoring technologies.

âœ… **Key Concepts/Topics Covered in this Section**
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): Monitor/detect (IDS) and prevent/mitigate (IPS) network attacks.
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP): Protocol for managing and monitoring network devices.
- Network Sensors: Devices/software that collect data about network traffic for monitoring and analysis.
- Packet Captures: Recordings of network traffic for analysis and diagnosis.
- Network Flow Data: Information collected about traffic flowing through a network device (source, destination, volume, path).
- Log Aggregation: Collecting, centralizing, and organizing log data from various systems.
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Aggregates, correlates, and analyzes security-related data to identify incidents and threats.
- Network Performance Metrics: Quantitative measures to evaluate network service levels (e.g., latency, bandwidth, jitter).
- Interface Statistics: Detailed metrics on performance and usage of network interfaces (error rates, utilization, traffic volumes).
