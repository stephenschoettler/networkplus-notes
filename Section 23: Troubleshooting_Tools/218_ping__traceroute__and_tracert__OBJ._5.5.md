## ðŸ’¡ ping, traceroute, and tracert (OBJ. 5.5)
This section covers the essential command-line tools `ping`, `traceroute`, and `tracert`, detailing their usage for network connectivity testing, path analysis, and systematic troubleshooting.

âœ… **ping, traceroute, and tracert**
- Essential command-line tools for network connectivity testing and path analysis.

âœ… **`ping`**
- Purpose: Checks basic connectivity between two devices.
- Mechanism: Sends ICMP Echo Requests, listens for Echo Replies.
- **Windows:**
  - `ping [target]`: Sends 4 pings.
  - `ping -n [count] [target]`: Sends `count` pings.
  - `ping -t [target]`: Pings continuously (Ctrl+C to stop).
- **Linux/Unix/OS X:**
  - `ping [target]`: Pings continuously by default.
  - `ping -c [count] [target]`: Sends `count` pings.
- **Common Option (all OS):** `ping -6 [target]` (forces IPv6).
- Output: Shows round-trip time (latency), packet loss, average time.

âœ… **Systematic Troubleshooting with `ping`**
- **1. Ping external domain/IP (e.g., `google.com` or `8.8.8.8`):**
  - Success: Internet OK.
  - Domain fails, IP succeeds: DNS issue.
  - Both fail: Internet connection issue.
- **2. Ping default gateway:**
  - Success: Connectivity to gateway OK; issue is beyond gateway.
  - Fail: Issue between client and gateway (cabling, switches).
- **3. Ping local client's IP:**
  - Success: Network card OK; issue is external cabling/switches.
  - Fail: Issue with local network configuration/hardware.
- **4. Ping localhost (`127.0.0.1`):**
  - Success: Network card/drivers installed.
  - Fail: Network card drivers corrupted/not installed.

âœ… **`traceroute` / `tracert`**
- Purpose: Displays the path (hops) between your device and a destination.
- **Command Names:** `traceroute` (Linux/Unix/OS X), `tracert` (Windows).
- **Mechanism:** Uses TTL (Time To Live) field in IP packets. Sends packets with incrementing TTLs to identify each router/firewall (hop).
- **Common Option (all OS):** `traceroute -6 [target]` (forces IPv6).
- Output: Lists each hop's IP/hostname and round-trip times.
- **Interpretation:**
  - `* * * Request timed out.` or `!`: Indicates a device (often a firewall) that doesn't respond to ICMP, but is still a hop in the path.
  - Useful for identifying where connectivity breaks or latency increases.
