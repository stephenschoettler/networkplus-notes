## ðŸ’¡ 802.11 Standards (OBJ 1.5)

The IEEE 802.11 standard defines the technologies used for Wi-Fi communications. Over the years, these standards have evolved to provide faster speeds and more reliable connections. Be aware of the difference between marketing claims and the official IEEE standards. For the exam, remember that **802.11ac itself is a 5 GHz-only standard**. The only true dual-band standards (per the official specifications) are **802.11n** and **802.11ax**.

âœ… **Wi-Fi Standards Overview**
| Standard | Also Known As | Frequency Band(s) | Max Speed | Max Range (approx.) | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **802.11a** | Wi-Fi 1 | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps | 35m | - |
| **802.11b** | Wi-Fi 2 | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps | 140m | - |
| **802.11g** | Wi-Fi 3 | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps | 140m | - |
| **802.11n** | Wi-Fi 4 | 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz | 600 Mbps | 70m (2.4GHz) / 35m (5GHz) | MIMO |
| **802.11ac** | Wi-Fi 5 | 5 GHz | 6.9 Gbps | ~35m | MU-MIMO |
| **802.11ax** | Wi-Fi 6 / 6E | 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz | 9.6 Gbps | ~35m | MU-MIMO |

âœ… **Key Technologies**
- **MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output):**
  - Introduced with 802.11n.
  - Uses multiple antennas to send and receive data simultaneously, increasing data transfer speeds.
  - Acts like a hub, sharing bandwidth among users by switching between them.
- **MU-MIMO (Multi-User, Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output):**
  - Introduced with 802.11ac.
  - Allows multiple users to access the wireless network and access point at the same time.
  - Acts more like a switch, avoiding collisions and congestion, leading to higher speeds and reliability.

âœ… **Frequency Band Support Summary**
- **2.4 GHz only:** 802.11b, 802.11g
- **5 GHz only:** 802.11a, 802.11ac
- **Dual-Band (2.4 & 5 GHz):** 802.11n, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- **Tri-Band (2.4, 5, & 6 GHz):** 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6E)
